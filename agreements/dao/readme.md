## Purpose

Operational agreements serve as the structural foundation for DAO governance, focusing on:

- Establishing the DAO's legal framework and compliance requirements
- Defining formal decision-making processes and authority boundaries
- Creating clear contributor relationships and responsibilities
- Establishing mechanisms for resource allocation and accountability

## Implementation Approach

### Essential Operational Agreements

Most DAOs should include these core operational agreements:

- **Operating Agreement** - The legal foundation of the DAO (required for LLC structures)
- **Contributor Agreement** - Defines the relationship between individuals and the DAO
- **Governance Process** - Establishes how collective decisions are made
- **Role Definitions** - Clarifies authority and responsibility boundaries

### Development Process

When developing operational agreements:

1. **Balance formality with flexibility** - Create sufficient structure without over-specifying
2. **Apply legal expertise appropriately** - Involve legal counsel for core documents while keeping most governance in plain language
3. **Separate legal requirements from operational preferences** - Use the operating agreement as a lightweight foundation, with details in linked policies
4. **Align with existing practice** - Document how you actually work rather than aspirational ideals
5. **Test with scenarios** - Verify agreements work for common situations before finalizing

### Agreement Structure

Effective operational agreements typically include:

- **Purpose and Scope** - What the agreement covers and who it applies to
- **Rights and Responsibilities** - Clear expectations for all parties
- **Decision Processes** - How collective choices are made
- **Resource Allocation** - How work is compensated or supported
- **Term and Termination** - How relationships begin and end
- **Amendment Process** - How the agreement itself can change

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing operational agreements:

- **Onboarding Integration** - Ensure new contributors explicitly consent to agreements
- **Accessibility** - Make agreements understandable to all bound by them
- **Hierarchy Clarity** - Define how different agreements relate to each other
- **Extensibility** - Create a framework that can evolve with the organization
- **Enforceability** - Only include provisions you're prepared to uphold
