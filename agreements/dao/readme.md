# DAO Operational Agreements Implementation Guide

This directory contains agreements defining formal structures and processes within the DAO. These agreements establish rights, responsibilities, and relationships among contributors who actively participate in organizational operations.

*This implementation guide should be removed when deploying your governance documentation.*

## Purpose of Operational Agreements

Operational agreements create the structural framework for DAO governance, defining decision-making, resource allocation, and work coordination. Unlike community agreements focused on interpersonal dynamics, these address the mechanics of collective action â€“ systems and processes enabling organized function.

These agreements bind those with formal roles or responsibilities within the DAO. This distinction reflects that different participation levels involve different commitments. Contributors engaged in operational work need clarity about decision flows, resource allocation, and coordination protocols.

## Development Process

Balance structure with adaptability when creating operational agreements. Effective frameworks provide clarity for coordinated action while remaining flexible for changing circumstances. Overly rigid agreements stifle innovation; overly vague ones create confusion.

Begin by understanding your DAO's core functions. What decisions need making? What resources require allocation? What roles need filling? What coordination must happen? Map these fundamental requirements before designing specific agreements.

Consider governance patterns aligning with your community's values. Different operational models reflect different priorities and work better in different contexts. Choose approaches authentically expressing your values rather than defaulting to popular models that might not serve your needs.

Develop agreements through participatory processes engaging people who will operate within them. Effective agreements emerge from collective wisdom rather than top-down design. This builds understanding and buy-in improving implementation.

Start with minimal viable agreements allowing evolution through experience. Focus on clear foundations that can be refined as your organization grows. Document actual practices rather than aspirational ideals, creating processes for regular review and adaptation.

## Key Elements

**Decision-making frameworks** establish how collective choices emerge at different organizational levels. Consider what approaches best serve different decision types. Strategic decisions might benefit from inclusive deliberation and high consent thresholds, while tactical choices might function better with delegated authority. Effective frameworks distribute authority appropriately, matching decision rights with expertise and impact.

**Resource allocation systems** create mechanisms for directing shared resources toward collective purposes. These address financial resources and other organizational capacity like attention and skills. Well-designed agreements establish transparency about resource availability, allocation decisions, and use tracking while maintaining flexibility for emerging opportunities.

**Role definition frameworks** clarify how responsibility and authority distribute across contributors. These establish how roles emerge, get filled, receive support, and handle transitions. Effective agreements balance providing accountability clarity with maintaining contextual adaptability. They focus on functions needing fulfillment rather than rigid job descriptions.

**Coordination mechanisms** enable different organizational parts to work together without centralized control. These establish information flow between teams, dependency management, and conflict resolution processes. Good coordination creates clear interfaces between groups while preserving autonomy within domains.

## Integration Considerations

**Cultural foundations** - Operational agreements build upon cultural context established through community agreements. Consider how formal structures express and reinforce community values rather than existing as separate technical systems.

**Participation pathways** - Consider how people progress from casual participation to formal operational roles and what support they receive during transitions. Effective governance creates clarity about contribution opportunities while maintaining accessibility.

**Learning systems** - Include mechanisms for reflection, evaluation, and adaptation based on lived experience. Collect feedback about process effectiveness, identify needed changes, and implement improvements maintaining operational continuity.

**Governance coherence** - Consider how operational agreements interact with community agreements, technical systems, and legal structures. Maintain appropriate boundaries between domains while ensuring sufficient integration for aligned action.
