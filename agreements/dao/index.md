# DAO Operational Agreements

This section contains the operational agreements that govern formal structures and processes within our DAO. These agreements establish rights, responsibilities, and relationships among members who contribute directly to organizational operations.

## Foundation of DAO Governance

Operational agreements define how our DAO functions as an organized entity, creating structures that enable coordinated action toward shared purpose. Unlike community agreements that focus on interpersonal dynamics, these address the mechanics of organizational function – decision-making, resource allocation, and work coordination.

The distinction between community and operational agreements reflects different contexts requiring different frameworks. While anyone can participate through basic behavioral norms, contributing to operations involves more specific commitments. Operational agreements create clarity about these commitments, ensuring contributors understand both their authority and responsibilities.

These agreements serve essential functions in our governance ecosystem. They establish legitimate decision-making processes all members recognize. They distribute authority balancing autonomy with coordination. They create accountability mechanisms ensuring actions align with values. They provide stability while allowing adaptation as we grow.

## Structural Elements

Our operational agreements create a coherent governance system with these key elements:

**Decision-making frameworks** enable collective choices efficiently and transparently. These distribute authority appropriately, matching decision rights with expertise and impact. Clear processes for proposals, deliberation, and implementation ensure decisions reflect collective wisdom while maintaining effectiveness.

**Resource allocation systems** help direct shared resources effectively toward objectives. These create transparency about resource management and deployment authority. Clear frameworks for budgeting, spending, and reporting ensure responsible stewardship while maintaining flexibility for emerging needs.

**Role definition structures** clarify responsibilities and authorities within the organization. These establish clear expectations while providing flexibility for contextual adaptation. Well-defined roles enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with collective direction.

**Coordination mechanisms** allow different parts of the organization to work together effectively. These establish information flow between teams, dependency management, and conflict resolution. Good coordination balances specialized focus with coherent action across the organization.

## Relationship to Community Agreements

Operational and community agreements form complementary parts of our governance ecosystem, each addressing different aspects of organizational life. For operational contributors, community agreements provide the cultural foundation upon which formal processes operate.

Decision-making frameworks, resource allocation, and coordination mechanisms all depend on healthy communication, trust, and shared behavioral norms to function as intended. When community agreements create strong relational fabric, operational processes can focus on their specific functions without managing basic interpersonal dynamics.

Contributors don't abandon community agreement obligations when taking operational roles – they add new commitments specific to their responsibilities. This layering recognizes that operational work occurs within broader community context, not separate from it.

This relationship creates continuity across the organization. When community and operational agreements remain aligned, contributors can move fluidly between contexts without experiencing value conflicts. Operational domains maintain appropriate autonomy while staying connected to broader community culture and purpose.

Operational agreements themselves emerge through governance processes that bridge community participation and operational coordination. This ensures changes maintain legitimacy through established decision-making while creating space for evolution as the organization learns and grows.
