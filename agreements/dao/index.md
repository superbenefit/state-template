# DAO Operational Agreements

This section contains the operational agreements that govern the formal structures and processes within our DAO. These agreements establish the rights, responsibilities, and relationships among DAO members who contribute directly to our projects and operations.

## The Foundation of Organizational Governance

Operational agreements define how our DAO functions as an organization, creating the structure that enables coordinated action toward our shared purpose. Unlike community agreements that focus on interpersonal dynamics, these operational agreements address the mechanics of organizational function â€“ how decisions are made, how work is coordinated, and how we remain accountable to each other.

The distinction between community and operational agreements reflects a key principle in our governance design: different contexts require different frameworks. While anyone can participate in our community by following basic behavioral norms, contributing to operations involves more specific commitments. Operational agreements create clarity about these commitments, helping ensure that contributors understand both their authority and their responsibilities within the organization.

These agreements serve several essential functions in our governance ecosystem. They establish legitimate decision-making processes that all members recognize. They distribute authority in a way that balances autonomy with coordination. They create accountability mechanisms that help ensure our actions align with our values and commitments. And they provide stability while allowing for adaptation as we learn and grow as an organization.

## Structural Elements

Our operational agreements work together to create a coherent governance system with several key elements:

Decision-making frameworks enable us to make collective choices efficiently and transparently. These frameworks distribute authority appropriately across the organization, matching decision rights with expertise and impact. Clear processes for proposals, deliberation, and implementation ensure that decisions reflect our collective wisdom rather than individual preferences.

Resource allocation systems help us direct our shared resources effectively toward our objectives. These systems create transparency about how resources are managed, what they're used for, and who has authority to deploy them. Clear frameworks for budgeting, spending, and reporting ensure responsible stewardship of organizational assets.

Role definition and accountability structures clarify who does what within the organization. These structures establish clear expectations for contributors while providing the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. Well-defined roles with appropriate authority enable people to act autonomously while remaining aligned with our collective direction.

Coordination mechanisms allow different parts of the organization to work together effectively. These mechanisms establish how information flows between teams, how dependencies are managed, and how conflicts are resolved. Good coordination balances the benefits of specialized focus with the need for coherent action across the organization.

## Relationship to Community Agreements

Operational and community agreements form complementary parts of our governance ecosystem, each addressing different aspects of organizational life. From the operational perspective, this relationship creates important contexts and foundations that shape how formal structures function within the broader community environment.

For operational contributors, community agreements provide the cultural foundation upon which formal processes can effectively operate. Decision-making frameworks, resource allocation systems, and coordination mechanisms all depend on healthy communication, trust, and shared behavioral norms to function as intended. When community agreements create a strong relational fabric, operational processes can focus on their specific functions without needing to also manage basic interpersonal dynamics.

The operational domain represents a specific context where community members take on additional commitments beyond basic participation. Contributors don't leave behind their obligations under community agreements when they take on operational roles - instead, they add new commitments specific to their operational responsibilities. This layering of agreements recognizes that operational work occurs within the broader community context, not separate from it.

This relationship creates important continuity across the organization. When community and operational agreements remain aligned, contributors can move fluidly between different contexts without experiencing value conflicts or contradictory expectations. The operational domain can maintain appropriate autonomy in how work gets done while remaining connected to the broader community's culture and purpose.

Operational processes frequently encounter tensions between different values or priorities that all serve the organization's purpose. Effective operational agreements don't attempt to eliminate these tensions but rather provide frameworks for navigating them productively. When operational and community agreements conflict, reconciliation processes focus on finding approaches that honor both domains rather than simply prioritizing one over the other.

The operational agreements themselves come into being through governance processes that bridge community and operational domains. This creates a self-referential system where the processes for evolving governance must follow existing governance frameworks. This ensures that changes to operational agreements maintain legitimacy by honoring established decision-making processes while creating space for evolution as the organization learns and grows.
