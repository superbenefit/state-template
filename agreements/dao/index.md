# DAO Operational Agreements

This section contains the operational agreements that govern the formal structures and processes within the DAO LLC. These agreements establish the rights, responsibilities, and relationships among DAO members who contribute directly to projects and operations.

## About Operational Agreements

Operational agreements define how the DAO functions as an organization, covering everything from its legal structure to decision-making processes and contributor relationships. Unlike community agreements that apply to anyone participating in the broader ecosystem, these operational agreements specifically bind formal DAO members who actively contribute to the organization's work.

These agreements provide the structural foundation that enables the DAO to:
- Make collective decisions efficiently and transparently
- Allocate resources effectively toward shared objectives
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for contributors
- Establish accountability mechanisms for all participants

## Relationship to Community Agreements

Operational agreements work in conjunction with community agreements, but serve a different purpose. While community agreements establish behavioral norms for all participants, operational agreements define the formal structures and processes for those who have taken on specific responsibilities within the organization.

All DAO members are bound by both operational agreements and community agreements. In cases where these agreements might seem to conflict, the issue should be resolved through the processes defined in the [Governance Process Policy](/policies/metagovernance/governance_process.md).

These agreements are maintained through the organization's governance process. Changes to operational agreements typically require formal approval through processes defined in the [Operating Agreement](operating_agreement.md) and [Metagovernance Policy](/policies/metagovernance/document_changes.md).
