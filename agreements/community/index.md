# Community Agreements

This section contains the agreements that establish shared expectations and behavioral norms for all community participants, regardless of their formal role or level of involvement with the organization.

## Universal Application

Community agreements create the cultural foundation for healthy interactions within our spaces. They apply to everyone who participates in our activities â€“ from casual visitors to active contributors. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics rather than operational processes, establishing consistent standards across all community contexts.

By clearly articulating behavioral expectations, we create an environment where diverse people can engage authentically while respecting necessary boundaries. This clarity benefits both newcomers and longtime members, providing consistency across our various activities and spaces.

## Who These Agreements Cover

These agreements govern all forms of community engagement:

**Community members** who participate in discussions, attend events, or engage with our content across various platforms. Whether learning about our mission or contributing to conversations, all participants agree to uphold our behavioral standards.

**Event attendees** at both online and in-person gatherings enter our spaces knowing these agreements guide participation. Event-specific guidelines may supplement but never override these foundational standards.

**Contributors** working on projects operate under these agreements alongside any operational agreements related to their specific roles. Community agreements provide the relational foundation upon which project collaboration builds.

**Organization members** with formal responsibilities remain bound by these agreements in all interactions. Leadership roles carry particular responsibility to model the values expressed here.

## Relationship to Organizational Structure

Community agreements and formal organizational structure support each other symbiotically. For community members, the organization provides structure through which collective values translate into coordinated action and tangible impact.

These agreements extend beyond formal organizational boundaries, creating continuity across different engagement levels. They apply equally whether someone participates casually or holds formal responsibilities, ensuring consistent culture regardless of role.

When community agreements and organizational practices become misaligned, this creates confusion about expectations and undermines trust in governance processes. Maintaining alignment between cultural standards and operational practice serves both domains, fostering coherence that enables authentic participation.

When conflicts arise regarding community agreements, resolution focuses on restoration and learning rather than punishment. This approach recognizes that community health depends on balancing accountability with understanding, supporting resilient relationships that enable effective collaboration over time.
