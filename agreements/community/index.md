# Community Agreements

This section contains the agreements that govern participation in our broader stakeholder ecosystem. These agreements establish shared expectations, norms, and codes of conduct for all community members, regardless of their stakeholder type or formal relationship with operational structures.

## The Role of Community Agreements in Multistakeholder Governance

Community agreements create the foundation for healthy and productive interactions across all stakeholder groups and contexts within our ecosystem. They translate our shared values into practical guidance for how different types of participants engage with each other, making implicit expectations explicit across our diverse stakeholder landscape. Through these agreements, we establish a culture that welcomes diverse stakeholder perspectives while maintaining the coherence necessary for collective action toward our shared purpose.

What distinguishes community agreements in a multistakeholder context is their universal application across stakeholder diversity. Community agreements apply to everyone who participates in our activities – from casual community participants to core contributors representing different stakeholder interests. They focus primarily on interpersonal dynamics and cultural norms rather than operational processes, helping ensure that all interactions reflect our shared values and purpose alignment regardless of stakeholder type or scale of engagement.

These agreements create a container for participation that balances openness to diverse stakeholder perspectives with alignment around shared purpose. By clearly articulating behavioral expectations and cultural norms, we create an environment where different types of stakeholders can engage authentically while respecting the boundaries necessary for a healthy ecosystem. This clarity benefits stakeholders across the spectrum of engagement, creating consistency that supports effective coordination across stakeholder boundaries without requiring uniform approaches.

## Who These Agreements Apply To

Our stakeholder ecosystem encompasses many different types and levels of participation. These agreements apply universally across our community, including:

Community members from various stakeholder backgrounds who engage across our platforms form the broader ecosystem around our coordinated work. Whether participating in discussions, attending events, or simply learning about our mission, these diverse stakeholders agree to uphold our community standards in all interactions, contributing to the cultural foundation that enables coordination across different groups.

Event participants and gathering attendees representing different stakeholder perspectives, whether online or in-person, enter our community spaces with an understanding that these agreements govern their participation. Event-specific guidelines may supplement but never override these foundational agreements that ensure consistency across all activities involving diverse stakeholder groups.

Stakeholder contributors working on specific projects, whether occasionally or regularly, operate under these agreements in addition to any operational agreements that might apply to their particular coordination role. The community agreements provide the social foundation upon which project collaboration and inter-stakeholder coordination builds.

Network members and formal participants, despite representing different stakeholder interests and having additional rights and responsibilities defined in operational agreements, remain bound by these community agreements in all their interactions. Leadership roles across different stakeholder groups come with a particular responsibility to model the values expressed in these agreements, demonstrating the purpose alignment that enables effective coordination across diverse stakeholder interests.

## Relationship to Multistakeholder Coordination

Community agreements and our multistakeholder operational structures exist in a symbiotic relationship, each supporting and informing the other. From the community perspective, this relationship creates both opportunities and responsibilities that shape how different stakeholder groups engage with coordination mechanisms and collaborative activities.

For community members across different stakeholder types, our coordination structures represent the manifestation of collective purpose through organized action – they provide the organizational patterns through which diverse stakeholder values translate into tangible impact. The network maintains and stewards community agreements, providing the stable cultural foundation that allows these agreements to persist and evolve across different stakeholder perspectives and changing participation patterns.

Community agreements extend beyond the formal boundaries of any specific stakeholder group or coordination mechanism, creating continuity across different types of participation within our ecosystem. They apply equally to someone from any stakeholder background casually participating in a discussion, a regular contributor representing specific interests, or a core member holding coordination responsibilities across stakeholder boundaries. This universal application creates a consistent culture that transcends formal roles and stakeholder divisions, enabling seamless coordination across diverse participant types.

This continuity serves several important functions within our multistakeholder structure. It prevents the emergence of cultural fragmentation between different stakeholder groups or operational domains. It ensures that all spaces – from open forums to cross-stakeholder working meetings – maintain consistent behavioral norms that support effective coordination across difference. It creates smooth pathways for people to move between different types of engagement and across stakeholder boundaries without encountering jarring cultural transitions.

When community agreements and formal operational structures become misaligned, participants experience this as a disruption to purpose-driven coordination – a gap between stated values and actual practice that undermines the trust necessary for effective multistakeholder collaboration. This creates confusion about expectations and erodes confidence in coordination processes across different stakeholder groups. Maintaining alignment between community agreements and multistakeholder operations serves both domains, fostering the coherence that enables authentic participation and effective coordination across diverse perspectives.

When tensions or conflicts arise regarding community agreements, their resolution typically involves processes that honor the wisdom of different stakeholder perspectives while providing sufficient structure for fair outcomes. These processes focus on restoration and learning rather than punishment, reflecting our commitment to maintaining healthy relationships and purpose alignment across stakeholder diversity over rigid enforcement. This approach recognizes that community health depends on balancing accountability with empathy and understanding across different stakeholder experiences, supporting the kind of resilient relationships that enable effective coordination across difference over time.
