# Community Agreements

This section contains the agreements that govern participation in our broader community ecosystem. These agreements establish shared expectations, norms, and codes of conduct for all community members, regardless of their formal relationship with the DAO.

## The Role of Community Agreements

Community agreements create the foundation for healthy and productive interactions within our digital and physical spaces. They translate our values into practical guidance for how we engage with each other, making implicit expectations explicit. Through these agreements, we establish a culture that welcomes diverse perspectives while maintaining the cohesion necessary for collective action.

What distinguishes community agreements from operational agreements is their scope and focus. Community agreements apply to everyone who participates in our activities â€“ from casual visitors to core contributors. They focus primarily on interpersonal dynamics rather than organizational processes, helping ensure that all interactions reflect our shared values regardless of context.

These agreements create a container for participation that balances openness with accountability. By clearly articulating behavioral expectations, we create an environment where people can engage authentically while respecting the boundaries necessary for a healthy community. This clarity benefits both longtime members and newcomers, creating consistency across our various spaces and activities.

## Who These Agreements Apply To

Our community ecosystem encompasses many different types of participation. These agreements apply to everyone involved, including:

Community members who engage on our social platforms form the broader ecosystem around our work. Whether participating in discussions, attending events, or simply learning about our mission, these members agree to uphold our community standards in all interactions.

Attendees at events and gatherings, whether online or in-person, enter our community spaces with an understanding that these agreements govern their participation. Event-specific guidelines may supplement but never override these foundational agreements.

Contributors working on projects, whether occasionally or regularly, operate under these agreements in addition to any operational agreements that might apply to their specific roles. The community agreements provide the social foundation upon which project collaboration builds.

DAO members and formal stakeholders, despite having additional rights and responsibilities defined in operational agreements, remain bound by these community agreements in all their interactions. Leadership within the organization comes with a particular responsibility to model the values expressed in these agreements.

## Relationship to the DAO

Community agreements and the DAO structure exist in a symbiotic relationship, each supporting and informing the other. From the community perspective, this relationship creates both opportunities and responsibilities that shape how people engage with the organization's more formal aspects.

For community members, the DAO represents the structural manifestation of collective purpose - it provides the organizational container through which communal values can translate into coordinated action and tangible impact. The DAO maintains and stewards community agreements, providing the stable foundation that allows these agreements to persist and evolve beyond individual relationships or temporary interactions.

Community agreements extend beyond the formal boundaries of the DAO itself, creating continuity across different levels of engagement. They apply equally to someone casually participating in a discussion, a regular contributor to projects, or a core member holding operational responsibilities. This universal application creates a consistent culture that transcends formal roles and responsibilities.

This continuity serves several important functions from the community perspective. It prevents the emergence of an "us vs. them" dynamic between formal DAO members and the broader community. It ensures that all spaces - from open forums to working group meetings - maintain consistent behavioral norms. And it creates smooth pathways for people to move between different levels of engagement without encountering jarring cultural transitions.

When community agreements and formal DAO operations become misaligned, the community experiences this as a form of organizational dissonance - a gap between stated values and actual practice. This creates confusion about expectations and undermines trust in governance processes. Maintaining alignment between community agreements and DAO operations serves the interests of both domains, fostering coherence that enables authentic participation.

When tensions or conflicts arise regarding community agreements, their resolution typically involves processes that honor community wisdom while providing sufficient structure for fair outcomes. These processes focus on restoration and learning rather than punishment, reflecting the community's interest in maintaining healthy relationships over rigid enforcement. This approach recognizes that community health depends on balancing accountability with empathy and understanding.
