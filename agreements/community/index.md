# Community Agreements

This section contains the agreements that govern participation in the broader community. These agreements establish shared expectations, norms, and codes of conduct for all community members, regardless of their formal relationship with the DAO LLC.

## About Community Agreements

Community agreements create the foundation for healthy and productive interactions within the organization's digital and physical spaces. These agreements apply to everyone who participates in community activities, including:

- Community members who engage on social platforms
- Attendees at events and gatherings
- Contributors working on projects
- DAO LLC members and formal stakeholders

Unlike operational agreements that govern internal DAO functions, community agreements focus on creating a welcoming, inclusive, and constructive environment for all participants.

## Current Community Agreements

* [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) - Behavioral expectations for all community members
* [Community Guidelines](community_guidelines.md) - Norms and practices for community participation
* [Communication Channels](communication_channels.md) - Appropriate uses for different communication platforms

## Relationship to DAO

While the DAO LLC maintains and enforces these agreements, they extend beyond the formal boundaries of the DAO itself. Community members may participate in various capacities without becoming formal DAO members, yet these agreements still apply to their interactions within the community ecosystem.

Violations of community agreements may be addressed through the processes outlined in the [Dispute Resolution Policy](/policies/community/dispute_resolution.md), which provides a framework for addressing concerns and resolving conflicts within the community.

These agreements are maintained through the organization's governance process. Community members can propose improvements or modifications by following the procedures outlined in the [Metagovernance Policy](/policies/metagovernance/document_changes.md).
