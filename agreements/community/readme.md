# Community Agreements Implementation Guide

This directory contains agreements that apply to all community participants, regardless of their formal relationship with the organization. These agreements establish the behavioral foundation for how people interact within your spaces.

*This implementation guide should be removed when deploying your governance documentation.*

## Purpose of Community Agreements

Community agreements create shared understanding that enables diverse participants to engage effectively together. They make implicit cultural norms explicit, reducing friction and creating psychological safety. Effective agreements balance clarity about boundaries with flexibility for authentic expression.

Unlike operational agreements that focus on organizational processes, community agreements address human dynamics that determine how your community feels to participants. They apply universally to everyone who engages with your organization, maintaining cultural consistency across all contexts.

## Development Process

Create agreements through inclusive conversations involving diverse perspectives from your community. Begin by identifying core values that drive interactions. What qualities should characterize your spaces? What behaviors support or undermine these qualities?

Focus on addressing your community's actual needs rather than using generic templates. Consider specific tensions or patterns in your interactions and develop agreements that address these real dynamics.

Write in clear, accessible language everyone can understand. Avoid jargon or abstract concepts. Include concrete examples that illustrate both aligned and misaligned behaviors to help people translate principles into practice.

Test draft agreements with community members before finalizing. Gather feedback about clarity, completeness, and enforceability. Build in regular review cycles for adaptation as your community evolves.

## Key Elements

**Communication norms** establish shared expectations about how people engage across different contexts. Consider how your values manifest in conversation practices. Effective norms create clarity about expectations while accommodating diverse communication styles.

**Participation expectations** clarify what constructive community membership means beyond basic behavioral boundaries. These address how people contribute to collective well-being through their presence. Well-crafted expectations recognize different capacity levels while establishing shared responsibility for community health.

**Conflict engagement** frameworks establish how the community approaches disagreement. Rather than avoiding conflict, these agreements recognize differences as potential sources of growth when engaged constructively. They provide processes for raising concerns and finding resolutions that maintain relationships.

**Boundary mechanisms** define limits that protect community well-being when behavioral issues arise. While focusing on aspirational values, these mechanisms address what happens when expectations aren't met. Effective boundaries balance community safety with opportunities for learning and restoration.

## Integration Considerations

**Agreement awareness** - Consider how new participants learn about expectations when they first engage. Rather than formal acceptance processes, integrate agreement content into onboarding through examples and visible modeling from established members.

**Learning processes** - Establish how the community handles situations where agreements aren't understood or followed. Focus on understanding gaps and supporting alignment rather than assuming intentional violation.

**Evolution mechanisms** - Agreements should adapt based on community experience rather than remaining static. Consider how your community reflects on agreements, identifies needed changes, and implements updates while maintaining continuity.
