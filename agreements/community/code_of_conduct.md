# Code of Conduct

This document is a placeholder. Insert or create a Code of Conduct which aligns with the community's needs and values.

## Purpose of a Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct establishes shared behavioral expectations for all participants in the community. Effective codes typically:

- Define acceptable and unacceptable behaviors
- Establish enforcement procedures for violations
- Create a foundation for inclusive participation
- Protect community health and psychological safety

## Common Elements to Consider

A comprehensive Code of Conduct typically includes:

1. **Community Values**: The foundational principles that guide interaction
2. **Expected Behaviors**: Specific actions that align with community values
3. **Prohibited Behaviors**: Clear boundaries for unacceptable conduct
4. **Reporting Process**: How to report potential violations
5. **Enforcement Policy**: How reports are handled and consequences determined
6. **Scope of Application**: Where and when the code applies
