# Agreement Registry

Welcome to our agreements repository, where we maintain the foundational documents that define relationships within our purpose-aligned network coordinating diverse stakeholder groups. While policies guide our systems and processes, agreements establish the coordination mechanisms between different types of participants – they clarify expectations, rights, and responsibilities that enable diverse stakeholders to work together effectively while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

## Understanding Agreements in Network Governance

Agreements play a distinctive role in our multistakeholder governance ecosystem. They create the foundation for coordination across diverse stakeholder groups by making expectations explicit between different types of participants. Unlike policies that govern systems or processes, agreements focus on relationships – between stakeholder groups and the network, among different types of contributors, and with external partners representing various constituencies.

What makes agreements powerful in a multistakeholder context is their capacity to enable coordination across stakeholder diversity without requiring uniform approaches. When different types of participants join our community or take on specific roles, they enter into these agreements with an understanding that their distinct perspectives and contributions are valued. This mutual commitment creates trust and accountability across stakeholder boundaries without requiring common institutional frameworks. Clear agreements enable different stakeholder groups to act autonomously within their domains while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose – the primary coordination mechanism that enables coherent action across diverse participants.

Agreements tend to be more stable than policies, changing less frequently but with broader impact when they do change. Many require explicit consent, especially those that establish formal rights and obligations within our network structure. This consent-based approach ensures that everyone operating within the network does so with a shared understanding of their relationship to the whole, fostering the kind of purpose alignment that enables effective distributed coordination.

## Types of Agreements

Our multistakeholder governance model incorporates several distinct types of agreements, each serving a different purpose in enabling coordination between diverse stakeholder groups:

Stakeholder participation agreements establish the fundamental relationships between different types of participants and the network. They define how various stakeholder groups can become part of our purpose-aligned community, what rights different types of participation confer, and what responsibilities come with different forms of engagement. These agreements create clarity about how diverse stakeholder groups relate to our ecosystem and what their participation means in practice for both individual autonomy and collective coordination across stakeholder boundaries.

Coordination agreements govern how different stakeholder groups and autonomous teams work together without compromising their distinct identities or approaches. They establish decision-making boundaries, resource flows, and coordination mechanisms that allow diverse groups to function effectively within the larger system. These agreements enable coordination across stakeholder differences while preserving the autonomy that allows different groups to contribute their unique perspectives and capabilities.

Role agreements clarify the authority and responsibilities of specific functions within the network structure. Unlike traditional job descriptions, these agreements focus on how roles enable coordination across the network – what authority they hold, what accountabilities they maintain, and how they interface with cells and other roles. They reflect our understanding that effective networks distribute authority based on expertise and purpose alignment rather than hierarchical position.

Stakeholder agreements establish relationships with external partners and constituencies, extending our coordination capabilities across organizational boundaries. They define how we collaborate with other organizations as nodes in larger stakeholder ecosystems, what resources or knowledge we share across stakeholder boundaries, and how we maintain purpose alignment while working with diverse external groups. These agreements enable fluid coordination that accommodates different stakeholder needs and approaches rather than requiring uniform institutional frameworks.

## Where to Find Agreements

In this repository, agreements are organized into categories that reflect different coordination contexts within our multistakeholder governance system:

The [Community](community/) directory contains agreements that apply to all stakeholder groups who participate in our broader ecosystem. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics and behavioral expectations that create a healthy, inclusive environment for diverse participants across different types of engagement. Community agreements apply universally across stakeholder types, creating a consistent cultural foundation that enables coordination across diversity.

The [DAO](dao/) directory houses operational agreements that govern formal structures and processes for stakeholders actively contributing to coordinated work. These agreements address how decisions flow across stakeholder groups, how resources move between different types of participants, and how work coordinates among those with specific roles and responsibilities. Operational agreements typically involve more explicit commitments and apply to stakeholders engaged in formal coordination mechanisms while respecting the distinct approaches and capabilities that different groups bring.

This distinction between community and operational contexts reflects a key multistakeholder governance principle: different types of stakeholder relationships require different coordination frameworks. By separating these agreement types, we can develop governance that appropriately addresses both the cultural foundations that enable diverse participation and the structural coordination elements that enable effective action across stakeholder differences while maintaining coherence around shared purpose.

As our stakeholder ecosystem evolves, this registry will grow to include new agreements and updated versions of existing ones. All changes follow our established governance processes, ensuring our agreements continue to reflect our collective understanding of how diverse stakeholder groups coordinate toward shared purpose while maintaining the autonomy and distinct contributions that make multistakeholder governance valuable.
