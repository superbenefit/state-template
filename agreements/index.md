# Agreement Registry

Welcome to our agreements repository, where we maintain the foundational documents that define relationships within our organization. While policies guide our systems and processes, agreements establish the social contracts between participants – they clarify expectations, rights, and responsibilities that enable us to work together effectively.

## Understanding Agreements in Governance

Agreements play a distinctive role in our governance ecosystem. They create the foundation for coordination by making expectations explicit between different parties. Unlike policies that govern systems or processes, agreements focus on relationships – between individual members and the organization, among teams, and with external partners.

What makes agreements powerful is their mutual nature. When someone joins our community or takes on a specific role, they enter into these agreements willingly. This mutual commitment creates both trust and accountability. Clear agreements enable autonomous action while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose – we can act independently knowing the boundaries and expectations that guide our participation.

Agreements tend to be more stable than policies, changing less frequently but with broader impact when they do change. Many require explicit consent, especially those that establish formal rights and obligations. This consent-based approach ensures that everyone operating within the organization does so with a shared understanding of their relationship to the whole.

## Types of Agreements

Our governance model incorporates several distinct types of agreements, each serving a different purpose in defining relationships:

Membership agreements establish the fundamental relationship between individual participants and the organization. They define what makes someone a member, what rights that confers, and what responsibilities come with membership. These agreements create clarity about who is part of the community and what that means in practice.

Group agreements govern how teams and circles work together and interface with the rest of the organization. They establish decision-making boundaries, coordination mechanisms, and accountability frameworks that allow groups to function effectively within the larger system.

Role agreements clarify the authority and responsibilities of specific functions within the organization. Unlike traditional job descriptions, these agreements focus on how the role relates to other parts of the system – what authority it has, what accountabilities it holds, and how it interfaces with other roles.

Network agreements establish relationships with external partners and stakeholders. They define how we collaborate with other organizations, what resources or information we share, and how we maintain alignment while working across organizational boundaries.

## Where to Find Agreements

In this repository, agreements are organized into categories that reflect different relationship domains and governance contexts:

The [Community](community/) directory contains agreements that apply to everyone who participates in our broader ecosystem. These agreements focus on interpersonal dynamics and behavioral expectations that create a healthy, inclusive environment for all participants. Community agreements typically apply regardless of someone's formal relationship with the organization, creating a consistent cultural foundation across all spaces and activities.

The [DAO](dao/) directory houses operational agreements that govern the formal structures and processes for members actively contributing to the organization's work. These agreements address how decisions are made, how resources are allocated, and how work is coordinated among those with specific roles and responsibilities within the organization. Operational agreements typically involve more explicit commitments and apply to a more defined subset of the community.

This distinction between community and operational domains reflects a key governance principle: different contexts require different frameworks. By separating these agreement types, we can develop governance that appropriately addresses both the cultural and structural elements of our organization while maintaining coherence between them.

As our organization evolves, this registry will grow to include new agreements and updated versions of existing ones. All changes follow our established governance processes, ensuring our agreements continue to reflect our collective understanding of how we work together.
