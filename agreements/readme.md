# Agreements Directory Implementation Guide

This directory contains foundational documents that define relationships within your organization. These agreements establish the social contracts that enable coordinated action while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

## Approaching Agreement Development

Agreements serve as the foundation for effective governance by creating shared understanding about how people relate to each other and to the organization. They define expectations, rights, and responsibilities in a way that enables autonomous action while maintaining collective coherence. Well-crafted agreements strike a balance between providing sufficient clarity for aligned action and maintaining flexibility for adaptation as circumstances change.

When developing your agreements ecosystem, begin with understanding the fundamental relationships that exist within your organization. Who participates, in what capacities, and with what expectations? What rights and responsibilities come with different forms of participation? How do different parts of your organization relate to each other? This relational mapping creates the foundation for developing agreements that address your actual governance needs.

Different types of relationships require different types of agreements. This repository structures agreements into two primary domains - community and operational - each addressing distinct aspects of your governance. Community agreements focus on how all participants interact, regardless of formal role, while operational agreements address how contributors engage in the organization's formal work. This division allows each domain to develop appropriate governance without unnecessary constraints.

## Organizing Your Agreements

This repository provides a framework for organizing agreements based on their scope and purpose. This organization isn't merely administrative - it reflects actual governance boundaries and authority domains within your organization. How you structure your agreements communicates important information about how authority and responsibility flow through your system.

The community directory contains agreements that apply universally to all participants in your ecosystem. These agreements establish the cultural foundation for all interactions, regardless of someone's formal relationship with the organization. They focus on interpersonal dynamics, communication norms, and behavioral expectations that create a healthy environment for participation.

The dao directory houses agreements that govern formal operational activities among contributors. These agreements establish decision-making processes, resource allocation mechanisms, role definitions, and coordination structures that enable effective collective action. They apply specifically to those who have taken on defined responsibilities within the organization.

As your organization evolves, you may identify additional agreement domains that deserve their own documentation space. When creating new agreement categories, consider:

Does this domain have distinct governance authority? New agreement sections should generally correspond to areas where specific groups have legitimate authority to make decisions.

Do these agreements bind a distinct group of participants? Consider whether these agreements apply to different people or in different contexts than your existing agreement types.

Does this domain address fundamentally different relationship types? New sections are most valuable when they govern relationships that function differently from those already documented.

## Developing Agreement Content

When drafting the content of specific agreements, focus on creating documents that clearly communicate expectations while inviting engagement. Agreements should feel like thoughtful explanations rather than legal contracts or technical manuals. They should help people understand not just what is expected, but why those expectations matter to the community.

For detailed guidance on developing specific types of agreements, refer to the readme files in each agreement subdirectory. These guides provide focused advice for creating effective community and operational agreements based on your organization's specific needs and context.

Remember that agreements evolve through experience. Begin with minimal viable documentation that addresses your current needs, and allow your agreements to develop as your organization grows and learns. The most effective governance documentation emerges from actual practice rather than theoretical ideals.

By thoughtfully developing your agreements ecosystem, you create the relational foundation that enables your organization to function effectively while remaining adaptable to changing circumstances and emerging opportunities.
