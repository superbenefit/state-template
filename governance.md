# Governance Repository Maintenance

This document establishes the framework for maintaining and evolving the Governance Repository. In decentralized organizations, governance documentation serves as both a record of collective decisions and a guide for future actions, providing a transparent, version-controlled history of the DAO's agreements, policies, and decisions.

## Purpose and Principles

The Governance Repository functions as the canonical record of the organization's governance state, representing the collective agreements that define how the organization operates and evolves. Unlike traditional documentation that often becomes outdated or fragmented, this repository ensures a comprehensive and auditable history of all governance changes.

Our approach to governance documentation rests on several foundational principles that guide both content and maintenance. The repository serves as a single source of truth for current policies, providing authoritative information about how our organization functions. It maintains transparency through visible, attributable changes that clearly communicate not just what has changed, but why and by whose authority. The repository implements due process through established procedures that ensure changes reflect legitimate community decisions rather than individual preferences. It ensures alignment between documentation and actual governance decisions, so that our stated policies accurately reflect our practiced governance. Perhaps most importantly, it prioritizes accessibility by structuring information to be understandable for all members, regardless of their technical background or governance experience.

These principles address common challenges in decentralized governance. When information is fragmented across platforms or exists only in institutional memory, power concentrates with those who have access to this knowledge. By creating transparent, accessible documentation, we distribute power more equitably and enable broader participation in governance. Similarly, without clear processes for updating documentation, governance records tend to drift from actual practice. Our structured approach to repository maintenance ensures that documentation remains an accurate reflection of our collective agreements.

## Relationship Between Repository and Governance

The repository documents governance decisions rather than creating them. This critical distinction means that repository changes should only reflect legitimate decisions made through the DAO's established processes. Only modifications approved through proper governance channels may be incorporated, preserving the system's integrity.

Consider what happens when a new policy is proposed: First, the community develops and approves the policy through established decision-making procedures. Only after this approval does the repository change to reflect the new policy. The act of updating the repository implements but does not itself constitute a governance decision, ensuring that governance remains a deliberative process while the repository serves as its faithful record.

This relationship extends to all repository changes, from minor formatting improvements to major restructuring. Each change must trace back to legitimate authority, whether through formal proposal approval or through delegated authority to maintainers for specific types of modifications. When we discover a discrepancy between documentation and practice, the solution is not simply to update the documentation—we must first determine whether practice should conform to documentation or whether formal governance processes should approve a documentation change.

## Change Process

Changes to the repository follow a structured process reflecting the organization's commitment to transparent governance. This process balances thoroughness with practicality, ensuring that significant changes receive appropriate consideration while avoiding unnecessary procedural burden for minor improvements.

### Proposal Development

The process begins with proposal creation according to established standards. For example, a member who identifies a gap in our operational policies might draft a new policy addressing this need. Proposals must clearly articulate the suggested changes and rationale, including exact text modifications. A well-formed proposal provides sufficient context for members to understand not just what would change, but why the change matters and how it relates to existing governance.

Before formal decision-making, proposals undergo community discussion and refinement. The author shares their suggestion in designated forums, allowing time for feedback. A member proposing a new conflict resolution policy might post it in the governance channel two weeks before voting, explicitly requesting input from those with relevant experience. This deliberation often improves the original proposal as authors incorporate community input. For instance, the conflict resolution policy might be refined to address edge cases identified by members during discussion.

### Decision-Making

After sufficient discussion, proposals move to formal decision-making through the DAO's established voting process. The finalized proposal is submitted for a vote, with voting periods conforming to the governance policies. Different types of changes may have different voting requirements—amending the operating agreement might require a supermajority, while updating a working group's operational procedures might need only a simple majority of affected members. For approval, the proposal must meet or exceed required thresholds.

### Implementation

Once approved, changes must be accurately implemented in the repository. Implementation typically occurs through pull requests or change requests that implement the exact changes specified in the approved proposal. For example, after the conflict resolution policy receives approval, a maintainer creates a pull request adding the new policy document, including all provisions as approved in the vote. These requests reference the approved proposal and undergo review by designated maintainers to ensure they faithfully implement the approved changes without unauthorized modifications.

All changes are documented in the DAO State Changes log, creating a traceable history of repository evolution. Proposals are archived for future reference, allowing members to understand not just current governance but how it developed over time. For instance, if questions arise about the intent behind a particular provision in the conflict resolution policy, members can refer back to the original proposal discussion to understand the reasoning that shaped that provision.

## Repository Maintenance

Designated maintainers handle the technical aspects of the repository, preserving its integrity by reviewing and merging approved changes. These maintainers need both technical skills and an understanding of the DAO's governance model to implement changes that align with its intentions.

Imagine a scenario where a proposal to update the treasury policy has been approved. A maintainer receives the implementation request and reviews it to ensure it accurately reflects the approved changes. The maintainer notices that the implementation includes additional modifications not specified in the proposal—perhaps reorganizing the document structure beyond what was approved. In this case, the maintainer would return the request for revision, ensuring that only the specifically approved changes are implemented. This careful review process maintains the integrity of our governance documentation.

Despite their technical authority, maintainers operate within clear limitations: they may only implement properly approved changes, can make minor formatting adjustments that don't affect substance, but may never overrule governance decisions. For example, a maintainer might correct a typo or improve document formatting without a formal proposal, but could not substantively alter a policy's provisions based on personal preference. Different types of changes follow proportional approval processes – substantive governance changes require formal proposals and voting, while minor technical maintenance may be performed with documentation but without formal proposals.

## Resolving Conflicts

The governance system includes mechanisms to address disputes constructively. Without explicit conflict resolution processes, documentation disputes can escalate unnecessarily or remain unresolved, undermining governance effectiveness.

Interpretation disagreements regarding governance documents are resolved according to processes defined in the operating agreement. For instance, if members disagree about whether a particular decision falls within a working group's delegated authority based on policy language, they would follow the interpretation process specified in the operating agreement rather than engaging in unstructured debate. This might involve bringing the question to a designated interpretation authority or following a specific deliberation protocol.

Technical implementation disputes are handled by repository maintainers with appropriate oversight. If maintainers disagree about whether a particular implementation accurately reflects an approved proposal, they would escalate the question to a designated decision-maker according to established procedures. This maintains the distinction between governance decisions (what should be implemented) and technical implementation (how it gets implemented).

Members who believe a repository change misrepresents an approved decision can utilize an appeals process through the DAO's dispute resolution policy. For example, if a member believes that a merged change includes provisions not actually approved in the proposal, they could file a formal appeal triggering review of the implementation against the approved proposal. This process ensures accountability while providing a structured path for addressing concerns.

This governance document itself follows the same change process as other governance documents, ensuring that meta-rules remain subject to the same standards of deliberation and approval as other governance matters. When we need to update how we govern our governance documentation, we follow the same transparent, inclusive processes used for all governance decisions.
