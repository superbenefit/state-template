# Contributing to Your DAO State Repository

This guide outlines how to effectively maintain and contribute to your governance documentation. A well-maintained DAO State Repository serves as both a practical reference and an accurate historical record of your organization's evolution.

## Guiding Principles for Contributions

The most effective governance documentation emerges from a balance of structure and narrative clarity. Each document should feel like a thoughtful explanation rather than a rigid template or checklist. Contributions should prioritize clarity and context while maintaining the integrity of the repository's organization.

When making changes, aim for accuracy first and foremost. The repository must reflect your organization's current governance rather than aspirational ideals. Changes should be transparent and traceable, allowing members to understand not just what changed, but why. All contributions should maintain consistent organization while ensuring the material remains accessible to both new and experienced members.

## Document Style Guide

When writing or updating governance documents, prioritize natural language flow over excessive structure. Develop ideas through cohesive paragraphs rather than defaulting to bullet points and nested headers. This approach creates more engaging, comprehensive documentation that invites careful reading rather than superficial scanning.

Reserve structural elements like headers, lists, and tables only for when they truly enhance readability:
- Use headers only for major sections or subsections, not for every new concept
- Employ bullet points or numbered lists only for specific sequences or truly distinct items
- Never substitute bullets for proper paragraph development

For governance documents specifically, explain principles and processes through thoughtful prose rather than listed rules. Use examples and context to illustrate abstract concepts, creating logical flow between sections rather than treating each as an isolated unit. The goal is to balance comprehensiveness with readability.

Before finalizing any contribution, review the document to ensure it reads as if written by a thoughtful human for other humans. Information should appear in digestible paragraphs rather than disconnected points, with headers serving as signposts that don't fragment the document. Remember that professional documentation doesn't mean rigid structure – it means clear, flowing exposition that guides readers through complex topics with narrative coherence.

## Repository Organization

The repository uses a three-part structure that reflects different aspects of governance:

Agreements form the foundation of your organization, establishing relationships and commitments between participants. These documents tend to change less frequently but have broader impact when they do change.

Policies translate agreements into practical systems and processes. Each policy domain has its own section, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity – different areas of your organization will govern their activities with appropriate autonomy.

Archives maintain the historical record of decisions and governance evolution. This section grows over time, creating an invaluable resource for understanding how and why your organization has changed.

Preserving this organizational structure helps members locate information intuitively and understand the relationships between different governance components.

## File Conventions and Workflow

Consistent file management makes the repository more navigable and changes more traceable. When creating or modifying files:

Use lowercase for all filenames and replace spaces with underscores or hyphens. Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate content, and maintain consistency across similar documents. For example, if you have `meeting_notes.md` in one directory, don't use `meeting-minutes.md` in another.

When committing changes, craft clear messages that explain both what changed and why. A well-structured commit message follows this pattern:

```
Update [document name]: [brief description]

[Optional longer explanation]
[Reference to proposal/issue number]
```

For example, "Update operating_agreement.md: Add dispute resolution process" immediately communicates the scope and purpose of the change. For more complex changes, the optional explanation provides context that helps others understand the reasoning behind the modification.

By following these guidelines, you'll help maintain a governance repository that serves as both a practical reference and an accurate historical record of your organization's evolution. Your contributions will be more accessible, understandable, and useful to the community as a whole.
