# DAO Governance Repository Template

Welcome to this governance repository template, designed for organizations that coordinate diverse participants toward shared goals. This repository provides a framework for creating comprehensive governance documentation that supports transparency and effective collaboration.

## Our Governance Approach

This template recognizes that DAOs function as purpose-aligned communities rather than traditional institutional structures. Effective governance emerges from clear agreements, transparent processes, and accessible documentation that enables diverse contributors to coordinate while preserving their unique perspectives and contributions.

The governance model creates frameworks that allow different types of participants to contribute meaningfully without forcing uniform approaches. Purpose alignment serves as the unifying mechanism that enables diverse contributors—from core teams to community participants to external collaborators—to coordinate effectively while maintaining their distinct characteristics and methods.

This approach distributes decision-making authority appropriately rather than centralizing control. The git-based structure reflects this inclusive design, ensuring that all voices can contribute to governance evolution through transparent, collaborative processes.

## Repository Structure

The governance documentation is organized into three interconnected sections:

**Agreements** establish the foundation for how different participants work together productively. These documents create clarity about how contributors relate to the shared purpose and to each other while respecting appropriate autonomy for different types of engagement.

**Policies** translate agreements into practical systems that enable coordination across different scales and domains. These frameworks evolve more frequently than agreements, allowing the governance system to adapt to changing needs while preserving foundational coordination mechanisms.

**Archives** maintain institutional memory of governance decisions and their outcomes. This section preserves records that demonstrate how collective decisions have shaped the organization, creating accountability and enabling new participants to understand the organization's development.

Together, these sections create a governance ecosystem that supports meaningful participation while ensuring coordination occurs in ways that advance shared purpose.

## Using This Template

Organizations implementing this template should adapt it to reflect their specific purpose, participant composition, and coordination needs. Focus on authentic representation of how different groups actually coordinate rather than imposing external frameworks.

The template supports various coordination patterns while providing a foundation for purpose-aligned collaboration. Adapt the language and structures to reflect your community's specific context and relationships.

When implementing, consider these coordination scales:

**Team coordination** occurs when small groups work together directly on specific initiatives. Governance focuses on maintaining alignment while preserving the unique contributions that diversity brings.

**System coordination** manages relationships between different groups and functions within the organization. This involves creating transparent interfaces that enable effective collaboration while respecting appropriate autonomy.

**Organization coordination** addresses direction-setting and resource allocation that affects the entire community. This scale creates mechanisms for diverse groups to participate meaningfully in collective decisions.

## Contributing to Governance

Governance evolves through the active participation of all community members. This template encourages participants to engage with governance documentation as contributors to its ongoing development.

Changes follow established decision-making procedures that preserve the integrity of collective agreements while enabling adaptive evolution based on changing circumstances and emerging needs.
