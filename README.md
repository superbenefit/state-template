# DAO Governance Repository Template

Welcome to this governance repository template, designed for DAOs that envision themselves as purpose-aligned networks coordinating diverse stakeholder groups toward shared goals. This repository serves as a framework for creating comprehensive governance documentation that supports both transparency and effective coordination across multistakeholder communities.

## Multistakeholder Governance Approach

This template embraces the understanding that DAOs function as networks coordinating across different types of stakeholders rather than traditional entities managing uniform members. Effective governance emerges from clear agreements, transparent processes, and accessible documentation that enables diverse stakeholder groups to coordinate while preserving their distinct identities, needs, and contributions.

The governance model reflected in this template creates frameworks that enable different stakeholder types to contribute without forcing them into common institutional structures. Purpose-alignment serves as the unifying mechanism that allows diverse stakeholders—from core contributors to community participants to external partners—to coordinate effectively while maintaining their unique perspectives and approaches. This governance system wraps around both community and operational domains rather than subordinating one to the other.

Recognition that different stakeholder groups require different engagement patterns guides the template's approach to distributed authority. Rather than optimizing for single metrics like efficiency or innovation, multistakeholder governance creates multiple pathways for meaningful participation that respect the diverse needs and capacities of different participant types. The git-based structure reflects this inclusive approach, ensuring that all stakeholder voices can contribute to governance evolution through transparent, collaborative processes.

## Repository Structure 

The governance documentation is organized into three interconnected sections, each serving a distinct purpose in multistakeholder coordination:

**Agreements** form the foundation of the network by establishing coordination mechanisms between diverse stakeholder groups. These documents enable different types of participants to work together productively without requiring uniform approaches or losing their distinct characteristics. Agreements create clarity about how various stakeholder groups relate to the shared purpose and to each other while respecting appropriate autonomy.

**Policies** translate agreements into practical systems that enable diverse stakeholder groups to coordinate activities across different scales and domains. These frameworks accommodate the varying needs, capacities, and priorities of different stakeholder types while maintaining coherence around shared objectives. Policies evolve more frequently than agreements, allowing the governance system to adapt to changing stakeholder needs while preserving foundational coordination mechanisms.

**Archives** maintain the network's institutional memory of how different stakeholder groups have participated in governance evolution over time. This section preserves records that demonstrate how diverse perspectives have shaped collective decisions, creating accountability across stakeholder boundaries and enabling new participants from any background to understand the network's development.

Together, these sections create a governance ecosystem that supports meaningful participation by diverse stakeholder groups while ensuring that coordination occurs in ways that advance shared purpose rather than privileging particular types of participants.

## Adaptive Implementation

This template is designed to accommodate diverse multistakeholder coordination approaches while providing a foundation for purpose-aligned collaboration. Different organizations will implement governance differently based on their stakeholder composition, shared purpose, and coordination challenges.

The template supports various patterns of stakeholder coordination, recognizing that effective governance emerges from understanding and respecting different stakeholder perspectives rather than imposing uniform processes. It accommodates diverse approaches to resource allocation, role definition, and decision-making while ensuring that all stakeholder groups have appropriate pathways for meaningful participation and influence.

When implementing this template, focus on adapting the language and structures to reflect your community's specific stakeholder landscape and shared purpose. The governance repository should authentically represent how different stakeholder groups actually coordinate rather than imposing external frameworks that don't align with your stakeholder relationships or purpose.

## Coordinating Across Scales

This template recognizes that multistakeholder networks require different coordination mechanisms at different scales of operation:

**Collaboration scale** coordination occurs when small groups representing different stakeholder perspectives work together directly on specific initiatives. Governance at this scale focuses on maintaining alignment across stakeholder differences while preserving the unique contributions that diversity brings to problem-solving.

**Coordination scale** governance manages relationships between different stakeholder groups and functions within larger networks. This involves creating transparent interfaces and communication mechanisms that enable effective collaboration across stakeholder boundaries while respecting appropriate autonomy for different group types.

**Constituency scale** coordination addresses direction-setting and resource allocation that affects the entire multistakeholder network. Governance at this scale creates mechanisms for diverse stakeholder groups to participate meaningfully in collective decisions while ensuring that shared purpose remains the primary organizing principle.

## Enabling Collective Intelligence

The repository supports distributed decision-making where good choices emerge through coordination across diverse stakeholder groups rather than centralized control. This approach harnesses the unique perspectives and expertise of different stakeholder types while maintaining coherence around shared purpose.

Purpose-driven alignment creates coherence across stakeholder diversity without requiring uniformity. When all participants understand and commit to the network's shared purpose, coordination can occur effectively even when different stakeholder groups maintain distinct approaches, priorities, and operational methods. The template supports this by emphasizing purpose as the primary coordination mechanism that transcends stakeholder boundaries.

Transparent information flows enable different stakeholder groups to make contextually appropriate decisions while understanding their impacts on other parts of the network. When activities, needs, and resource flows are visible across stakeholder boundaries, coordination can emerge organically rather than requiring constant negotiation or management overhead.

## Contributing to Network Governance

Governance within multistakeholder networks evolves through the active participation of diverse community members. This template encourages all participants—regardless of their stakeholder type or role—to engage with governance documentation as contributors to its ongoing development rather than passive consumers.

Changes to governance documentation follow established decision-making procedures that respect the legitimate interests of different stakeholder groups while enabling adaptive evolution. Implementation occurs through collaborative processes that preserve the integrity of collective agreements across stakeholder boundaries while allowing for contextual adaptation based on changing circumstances and diverse stakeholder needs.

## Network Evolution

This template recognizes that governance must evolve as networks learn and grow across different stakeholder perspectives. Unlike traditional organizations that require formal restructuring when stakeholder needs change, purpose-aligned networks can adapt by creating new coordination mechanisms and pathways for participation that serve emerging stakeholder configurations.

Different stakeholder groups within the network may evolve their participation patterns and coordination mechanisms at different rates and through different processes. The governance system accommodates this diversity while maintaining coherence through shared purpose and transparent communication that enables mutual understanding across stakeholder boundaries.

The documentation framework supports both stability and adaptation, preserving institutional memory while enabling responsive change that serves diverse stakeholder interests. Rather than requiring all stakeholder groups to adopt identical governance approaches, the template creates space for different groups to develop coordination methods that serve their specific needs while maintaining alignment with collective purpose.
