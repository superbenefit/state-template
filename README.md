# SuperBenefit DAO Governance Repository

Welcome to the governance repository of SuperBenefit DAO, where we maintain the collective agreements, policies, and decisions that guide our community. This repository serves as our shared source of truth, enabling transparent collaboration and aligned action as we pursue our mission of advancing regenerative economics through open-source infrastructure.

## Our Governance Approach

At SuperBenefit, we believe that effective governance emerges from clear agreements, transparent processes, and accessible documentation. This repository embodies these principles, creating a comprehensive record of how we operate, make decisions, and evolve over time. Unlike traditional organizational documents that quickly become outdated, our version-controlled approach ensures that our governance remains current while preserving our historical evolution.

Our governance model balances structured frameworks with adaptive processes. We distribute decision-making authority across different domains, allowing those with relevant expertise to act autonomously while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose. By documenting these domains and their boundaries, we create clarity about how decisions legitimately flow through our organization.

The git-based structure of this repository reflects our commitment to decentralized governance. Version control creates transparency about who proposed changes and why, provides immutable records of our evolution, and enables collaborative development of our governance through familiar collaboration workflows. For our community members engaged with on-chain activities, this repository bridges technical operations with their human-readable context, ensuring alignment between implementation and intention.

## Repository Contents

Our governance documentation is organized into three main sections, each serving a distinct purpose in our collective coordination:

**Agreements** form the foundation of our community by establishing relationships between participants. These documents define our shared expectations, rights, and responsibilities. Our agreements include our operating agreement, code of conduct, and community guidelines—documents that create clarity about what it means to be part of SuperBenefit and how we relate to each other.

**Policies** translate our agreements into practical systems and processes. Organized into domains like metagovernance, operations, and platforms, these documents establish the procedures and standards for our various activities. Policies evolve more frequently than agreements, adapting to our emerging needs while maintaining alignment with our fundamental principles.

**Archives** maintain our historical record of decisions and governance evolution. This section preserves our proposals, treasury decisions, and governance changes, creating institutional memory that helps new members understand our journey and enables us to learn from our collective experience. Our archives demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accountability.

Together, these sections create a complete governance ecosystem that supports informed participation by all community members.

## Using This Repository

This repository serves different needs for different participants in our community. Whether you're a new member seeking orientation, an active contributor participating in governance, or a working group leader coordinating activities, you'll find relevant guidance here.

For those new to SuperBenefit, we recommend starting with our agreements section to understand our community's purpose and values. The code of conduct and community guidelines provide essential context about how we work together, while the operating agreement establishes our formal organizational structure.

Active contributors will find the policies section particularly valuable for effective participation. The metagovernance policies explain how proposals are developed and decisions are made, while operational policies provide frameworks for coordinating work and managing resources.

Working group leaders should become familiar with both the agreements that establish their authority and the policies that guide their activities. Understanding these governance foundations enables effective leadership within our distributed structure.

## Contributing to Governance

Our governance evolves through the active participation of community members. We encourage all members to engage with this documentation—not just as readers, but as contributors to its ongoing development. If you identify opportunities for improvement or have suggestions for new policies, please engage with our governance processes as documented in the metagovernance section.

Changes to this repository follow our established decision-making procedures, ensuring that modifications reflect legitimate community decisions. Maintainers implement changes that have received appropriate approval, preserving the integrity of our governance records.
