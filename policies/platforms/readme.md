# Platform Policies

This directory contains the policies that govern your network's digital infrastructure - the tools, systems, and online spaces where coordination happens across distributed cells and contributors. These policies ensure that your technical foundation supports rather than constrains your network's ability to achieve both operational efficiency and continued innovation.

## Digital Infrastructure as Network Enabler

Platform governance in networked organizations goes far beyond technical administration. The design and management of your digital tools profoundly shapes how cells coordinate, how information flows through the network, and which kinds of collaboration become possible or constrained. The permissions structure of a chat system, the organization of shared repositories, or the architecture of documentation platforms all embed assumptions about coordination that either enable distributed intelligence or recreate centralized bottlenecks.

Effective network platform policies recognize this governance dimension of technical choices. They don't merely address functional requirements but explicitly consider how digital infrastructure affects power distribution, accessibility, and the emergence of collective intelligence. The goal is creating digital spaces that embody the same principles that guide your network's coordination - enabling cells to work autonomously while maintaining transparent interfaces that support network-wide coherence and purpose alignment.

Like operations, platform governance typically operates under delegated authority independent from network-wide governance processes. This autonomy allows technical teams to respond quickly to security concerns, user experience issues, and evolving technological contexts without creating coordination overhead that slows necessary adaptations. However, this autonomy operates within clear boundaries established by network agreements, particularly regarding how platforms support the network's fundamental commitment to distributed coordination.

## Creating Network-Appropriate Platform Policies

When developing platform policies for networked organizations, consider approaches that support the unique requirements of distributed coordination:

Center the coordination needs of cells and distributed contributors rather than administrative convenience. Network platform policies should prioritize the experience of people working across different cells, time zones, and contexts, especially those who may be new to network coordination practices. Regular feedback from diverse users across the network and accessibility reviews should inform your approach to ensure platforms serve everyone effectively.

Document both the technical specifications and the coordination philosophy behind platform choices. Network platforms do more than provide functionality - they create the substrate upon which distributed intelligence emerges. Effective platform policies explain not just how systems are configured but why particular approaches support network coordination, helping administrators make consistent decisions when facing new situations while enabling others to understand how platform choices affect their work.

Balance security and privacy with the transparency needed for network coordination. Every access restriction or privacy measure creates trade-offs with the visibility that enables network coordination and collective intelligence. Rather than applying maximum restrictions by default, consider the actual security and privacy needs within the context of network operations. Use graduated transparency and access levels that protect sensitive information while supporting the information flow that enables distributed decision-making.

Provide clear pathways for cells to request platform modifications, report issues, or suggest improvements. Networks depend on continuous adaptation and innovation, including in their digital infrastructure. Make it straightforward for any cell or contributor to identify platform barriers to their work, propose improvements, or request exceptions to standard policies when their coordination needs require different approaches.

## Network Platform Governance Areas

The structure of this directory reflects platform governance concerns adapted for networked organizations:

Access and permissions management governs how people gain access to network systems, what capabilities different roles and cells have, and how access evolves as people's involvement with the network changes. Network access policies need to balance security with the permissionless participation that enables network growth and innovation. Clear onboarding processes help new contributors engage effectively while offboarding procedures protect network resources when people's involvement changes.

Coordination infrastructure covers the platforms and tools that enable cells to coordinate internally and interface with each other and the broader network. This includes communication systems that work across different scales of interaction, shared workspace tools that preserve cell autonomy while enabling collaboration, and documentation platforms that support both local adaptation and network-wide knowledge sharing. These policies ensure that platform choices support rather than constrain the coordination patterns that make networks effective.

Information architecture and transparency policies establish how information is organized, shared, and made accessible across the network. Effective networks depend on information flowing to where it's needed while respecting appropriate privacy and security boundaries. These policies address documentation standards that make network knowledge accessible, transparency practices that enable accountability and learning, and information governance that balances openness with protection of sensitive materials.

As your network grows and evolves, you might need additional platform governance areas that address the unique aspects of supporting distributed organizations:

- Integration standards between different tools and platforms used by different cells
- Privacy and data sovereignty policies that address network-scale information sharing
- Innovation and experimentation frameworks for testing new coordination tools
- Inter-network platform coordination for network-to-network collaboration

## Evolving Network Platform Infrastructure

Digital tools and coordination technologies change rapidly, and your platform policies need to adapt accordingly while maintaining stability in core network functions. Network platform governance succeeds when it enables rather than constrains the coordination innovations that cells and contributors develop to work together more effectively. When updating platform policies:

1. Include both technical administrators and regular users from across the network in design and review processes
2. Consider implications for people working at different scales - from cell-internal coordination to network-wide collaboration
3. Provide transition plans and support when making significant changes that affect how cells coordinate
4. Document not just current configurations but the coordination principles and decision history that inform platform choices

Remember that network platform governance reaches its goals when it becomes largely invisible to contributors - when people can focus on their work and coordination without fighting against digital tools or being constrained by them. The most effective network platforms feel like natural extensions of how the network pursues its purpose, supporting the emergence of collective intelligence rather than imposing artificial limitations on how cells and contributors coordinate their efforts.

By thoughtfully governing your platforms as network infrastructure, you create the digital substrate that enables more effective coordination across all domains of your network's activities, supporting both the operational efficiency and the innovation emergence that healthy networks can uniquely achieve.
