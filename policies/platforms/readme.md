# Platform Policies

This directory contains policies governing your organization's digital infrastructure - the tools, systems, and online spaces where collaboration happens. These policies ensure that your technical foundation supports rather than hinders your community's work.

## Digital Infrastructure as Governance

Platform governance is often overlooked, but the design and administration of your digital tools profoundly shapes how people participate in your organization. The permissions structure of a Discord server, the organization of a GitHub repository, or the architecture of a documentation site all embed governance assumptions that either enable or restrict certain types of collaboration.

Effective platform policies recognize this governance dimension of technical choices. They don't just address functional requirements but explicitly consider how digital infrastructure affects power dynamics, accessibility, and inclusion. The goal is creating digital spaces that embody the same values and principles guiding your organization's other activities.

Like operations, platform governance typically has delegated authority independent from community governance processes. This autonomy allows technical teams to respond quickly to security concerns, user experience issues, and changing technological contexts without excessive process overhead.

## Creating Human-Centered Platform Policies

When developing policies for this domain, consider these practical approaches:

**Center user needs** rather than administrative convenience. Platform policies should prioritize the experience of contributors, especially new ones, over what's easiest to implement or maintain. Regular user feedback and accessibility reviews should inform your approach.

**Document the why, not just the how.** Technical documentation often focuses exclusively on procedures, but effective platform policies explain the reasoning behind configurations and processes. This context helps administrators make consistent decisions when facing new situations.

**Balance security with usability.** Every access restriction creates friction for legitimate users. Consider the actual security needs and risk profile of different systems rather than applying maximum restrictions by default. Use graduated access levels where appropriate.

**Provide clear pathways** for support and exceptions. Even the best-designed systems will occasionally create barriers for valid use cases. Make it easy for users to request help, suggest improvements, or request exceptions to standard policies.

## Platform Governance Areas

The structure of this directory reflects common platform governance concerns:

**Access management** policies govern how people gain access to systems, what permissions different roles have, and how access is reviewed and removed. Clear onboarding and offboarding processes protect both the organization and its members.

**Platform administration** defines how technical infrastructure is maintained, including security protocols, backup procedures, and maintenance schedules. These policies ensure reliability and appropriate protection of community resources.

**Content guidelines** establish standards for creating, organizing, and maintaining information across your digital systems. Consistent approaches to documentation help knowledge remain accessible as your organization evolves.

As your organization grows, you might need additional platform governance areas such as privacy and data handling policies, integration standards between systems, accessibility requirements, or external service provider relationships.

## Evolving Your Digital Infrastructure

Digital tools and environments change rapidly, so platform policies need regular review. When updating these policies:

1. Involve both technical administrators and regular users in the process
2. Consider implications for people with different technical comfort levels
3. Provide transition plans and support when making significant changes
4. Document not just current configurations but the decision history

Remember that platform governance succeeds when it becomes invisible - when people can focus on their work and collaboration without thinking about the tools themselves. The best digital infrastructure feels like a natural extension of your community's ways of working rather than a separate system to navigate.

By thoughtfully governing your platforms, you create the conditions for more effective participation across all other domains of your organization's activities.
