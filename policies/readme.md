# Policies Directory

This directory contains the policies that define how your network operates and makes collective decisions. Unlike the formal agreements that establish relationships between members, policies provide the practical frameworks that guide day-to-day activities and governance processes across your networked organization.

## Understanding the Network Policy Approach

We've designed this governance system around foundational principles that reflect the nature of decentralized networks. The first is subsidiarity - the idea that decisions should be made at the most local level possible by those who will be most affected. The second recognizes that modern DAOs function as purpose-aligned networks of autonomous cells rather than traditional hierarchical entities.

The folder structure you see here isn't just organizational - it represents actual governance boundaries that enable the network to achieve both operational efficiency (through structured coordination) and continuous innovation (through distributed intelligence). Each policy domain represents a distinct sphere of authority with its own delegated decision-making power, as defined in your organization's agreements. This approach balances autonomy with coordination, allowing specialized cells and teams to govern their activities effectively while maintaining transparency and purpose alignment across the network.

For example, while the Metagovernance domain might establish how proposals flow through the network's decision-making processes, the Operations domain has its own authority to determine how cells (autonomous teams) coordinate their work within the network. These domains don't form a hierarchy - they represent different spheres of authority that operate in parallel, creating a fractal structure where governance appropriately distributes across different scales and contexts.

## Working with Network Policies

When adding or modifying policies, place them in the appropriate domain folder based on:

- Who has authority over the policy area in your network structure
- Which scale of operation it governs (collaboration, coordination, or constituency level)
- Which cells or teams will maintain it
- How it supports the network's purpose alignment

Each policy document should include:

```
---
description: A brief description of what this policy governs within the network
---

# Policy Title

Introduction that explains the purpose and scope within the network context...

## Policy Sections

Content organized to support both efficiency and innovation...
```

The most effective network policies aren't overly prescriptive - they focus on establishing clear boundaries and interfaces that enable permissionless coordination while allowing flexibility in implementation. As you develop policies, focus on documenting how your network actually operates rather than aspirational ideals. Start with minimal viable governance and allow your policy documentation to evolve alongside your organization, always maintaining alignment with your shared purpose.

## Extending the Network Policy Structure

Your network will likely need additional policy domains beyond those included in this template. The ideal policy structure should reflect your specific network topology and governance needs rather than following a prescribed pattern. When extending the structure, consider how new domains support both Dynamic One (efficiency through structure) and Dynamic Two (innovation through emergence).

Consider your network's unique activities and scaling requirements. Different types of networks may need very different policy domains - a research collective might need domains for intellectual property and knowledge commons, while a mutual aid network might prioritize resource distribution and community support policies.

Look for natural divisions of authority in your network's governance model. New policy domains should generally align with distinct areas of delegated decision-making within your network. Creating a new domain isn't just an organizational choice - it should reflect actual governance boundaries that enhance the network's capacity to coordinate across scales while preserving cellular autonomy.

When adding a new policy domain:

1. Create a new directory with both index.md and readme.md files
2. Update the main policies/index.md file to reference the new domain
3. Establish clear boundaries and interfaces between the new domain and existing ones
4. Define the governance processes specific to that domain and how they connect to network-wide purpose alignment

The policy structure should evolve alongside your network. As new activities emerge or governance needs change, be prepared to refactor your policy domains to maintain clarity and effectiveness while supporting the network's ability to adapt and grow organically.

## Maintaining Network Policy Documentation

Policies should be living documents that evolve with your network's learning and growth. Regular review cycles help ensure they remain relevant and effective while supporting continuous adaptation. When updating policies:

1. Reference the governance process defined for the specific domain
2. Use collaborative development processes that reflect your network's distributed nature
3. Maintain version history that preserves the evolution of network governance
4. Communicate changes to affected cells and stakeholders across the network

Remember that while all policies are documented in this central repository for transparency, each domain operates according to its own governance processes. The documentation structure reflects network boundaries but doesn't override the autonomy that enables cells to innovate and adapt within their spheres of authority. This balance between documentation and autonomy creates the conditions for emergent strategy while maintaining network coherence through shared purpose.
