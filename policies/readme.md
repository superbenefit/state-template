# Policies Directory

This directory houses the procedures, standards, and guidelines that govern your organization's operations and decision-making processes.

*Since each organization has different policies and may use different ways to organize them, you should carefully consider how policies will be displayed for your organization and construct a folder structure to accommodate them. You can use this document as a starting place for that process.*

## Purpose

Policies create frameworks for consistent decision-making and action across your organization. Unlike agreements that focus on relationships, policies govern systems, processes, and organizational functions. Well-designed policies reduce decision fatigue while maintaining alignment with your shared purpose.

## Implementation Approach

### Common Policy Types

Most organizations develop policies for:

- **Governance** - Decision-making processes and permissions
- **Treasury** - Resource allocation and financial controls
- **Operations** - Day-to-day activity coordination
- **Platform** - Digital infrastructure management
- **Communication** - Information sharing and 

### Organization Patterns

Your governance model will influence how you organize policies:

- **By Decision Authority** - Separate policies by who can change them
- **By Functional Area** - Group by related activities or domains
- **By Formality Level** - Distinguish between binding rules and flexible guidelines

## Policy Development

Effective policy development follows these principles:

- **Start minimal** - Begin with only essential policies
- **Document actual practices** - Focus on current operations, not aspirational goals
- **Build in flexibility** - Avoid over-specification that constrains adaptation
- **Establish ownership** - Define who maintains and updates each policy

### Policy Components

Well-structured policies typically include:

- **Scope** - What activities the policy governs
- **Roles** - Who has authority and responsibility
- **Procedures** - Step-by-step processes
- **Criteria** - Standards for decision-making
- **Exceptions** - How to handle special cases
- **Review Cycle** - When and how the policy is updated
