# Operations Policies

This directory contains the policies that govern how your network's work gets done - how cells form and coordinate, how resources flow through the network, how projects emerge and develop, and how contributions are recognized. These policies translate your network's purpose into practical action while supporting both the operational efficiency and the innovation that networks can uniquely achieve.

## The Network Operations Layer

Operations is where your network's values and mission transform into coordinated activities and tangible outputs. While metagovernance focuses on how decisions emerge across the network, operational policies address how the actual work gets done through autonomous cells and collaborative structures. These policies create enough consistency and coordination for cells to work effectively together, while preserving the autonomy essential for innovation and adaptation.

The operational domain typically operates under its own governance authority, distinct from constituency-scale community governance processes. This autonomy is essential because operational contexts change rapidly and require specialized knowledge that exists within cells and working groups. Teams working directly on projects need the flexibility to adapt their processes without excessive coordination overhead, enabling the responsive adaptation that gives networks their advantage over hierarchical organizations.

Effective network operational policies find the balance between standardization and flexibility that enables both Dynamic One (efficiency through coordination) and Dynamic Two (innovation through emergence). Too much standardization creates bureaucracy that constrains the very autonomy that makes cells innovative; too little creates coordination problems that prevent network-scale impact. Good operational governance provides just enough shared interface for cells to coordinate effectively while preserving their internal adaptability.

## Developing Your Network Operations Framework

When creating operational policies for a networked organization, consider approaches that honor the fundamental characteristics of how networks operate:

Start by documenting how your network actually coordinates rather than imposing theoretical ideals. Network operations emerge from practice rather than design, so your policies should reflect and support existing patterns of effective collaboration. Begin with documenting how cells already coordinate resources, share information, and align with network purpose, then systematize these practices to make them more accessible and replicable.

Design policies that create clear interfaces between cells rather than prescribing internal operations. The power of cellular organization lies in cells' ability to adapt their internal practices to their specific context and function. Focus on defining what cells need to provide to each other and the broader network - inputs, outputs, and coordination touchpoints - while giving cells latitude in how they organize internally.

Enable permissionless coordination within clear boundaries. One of the key advantages of network organization is enabling people to see opportunities and begin working on them without requiring prior approval from central authorities. Your operational policies should support the three essential network freedoms: working on things without permission, attracting others to projects, and requesting resources from the network. Structure these freedoms with enough guidance to maintain purpose alignment without constraining innovation.

Create examples that illustrate both standard patterns and edge cases. Network operations, by their nature, encounter diverse situations that can't all be anticipated in advance. Your policies should address not just the typical coordination patterns, but also provide guidance for how cells handle resource constraints, resolve blockers, coordinate across different types of work, and maintain alignment with network purpose when contexts change rapidly.

## Key Network Operations Areas

The structure of this directory reflects common operational concerns adapted for networked organizations:

Cell governance documents how autonomous teams form, operate, and coordinate with other cells within the network. This includes processes for cell formation around emerging opportunities, role definition within cells, resource allocation between cells, and coordination frameworks that preserve cell autonomy while enabling network-wide coherence. Cell governance recognizes that healthy networks consist of cells that maintain clear purpose alignment while adapting their operations to their specific contexts.

Resource flow management covers how resources move through the network - from initial allocation to cells and projects, through to reinvestment in network growth and purpose advancement. Clear resource flow policies enable the kind of dynamic resource allocation that allows networks to respond quickly to opportunities while maintaining financial sustainability. These policies address budget development that involves input from across the network, spending authorities at different scales, and compensation frameworks that recognize diverse types of contribution.

Project lifecycle policies define how initiatives emerge from ideas anywhere in the network, develop through implementation, and integrate their results back into network knowledge and capacity. Network projects often start as experiments within cells but may grow to involve coordination across multiple cells or even transformation of network practices. These policies provide frameworks for project initiation, scale-appropriate approval processes, progress tracking that maintains network visibility, and evaluation that feeds learning back to the broader network.

As your network evolves, you might need additional operational areas that reflect the unique dynamics of networked organization:

- Cross-cell coordination for large initiatives
- Knowledge commons maintenance and evolution
- Innovation emergence and integration processes
- Network boundary spanning and partnership governance

## Maintaining Network Operations Autonomy

Remember that operational governance operates autonomously within the frame established by network agreements, though it remains accountable to the network's overall purpose and values. This autonomy is what enables networks to be responsive and innovative rather than bureaucratic. When updating operational policies:

1. Involve cells and contributors who will implement the processes in their design and refinement
2. Test changes in limited contexts before applying them across the network
3. Regularly review and simplify processes to prevent the accumulation of coordination overhead
4. Document not just procedures but the purpose they serve in supporting network function

The most successful network operations evolve continuously through practice and experimentation rather than being designed perfectly from the start. Create feedback loops that allow your operational policies to improve based on experience, changing network conditions, and emerging opportunities. This evolutionary approach reflects the fundamental characteristic of networks - their ability to adapt and learn as they operate.

Ultimately, network operational governance succeeds when it becomes largely invisible to those outside the network - they see the impact of your coordinated action but not the sophisticated coordination systems that make it possible. Good network operations feel like a natural extension of how the network pursues its purpose rather than a separate administrative layer imposed on the actual work.
