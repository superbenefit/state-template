# Operations Policies

This directory contains policies governing how your organization's work gets done - how teams form, how resources are allocated, how projects are managed, and how contributions are recognized. These policies translate your organization's purpose into practical action.

## The Operational Layer

Operations is where your organization's values and mission transform into tangible activities and outputs. While metagovernance focuses on how decisions are made, operational policies address what gets done and how. These policies create enough consistency to work effectively together while preserving autonomy for teams to adapt to their contexts.

The operational domain typically has its own governance authority, separate from community governance processes. This autonomy is essential because operational contexts change rapidly and require specialized knowledge. Teams working directly on projects need flexibility to adapt their processes without excessive overhead.

Effective operational policies find the balance between standardization and flexibility. Too much standardization creates bureaucracy that slows work; too little creates coordination problems across teams. Good operational governance provides just enough structure to enable collaboration while allowing for contextual adaptation.

## Developing Your Operational Framework

When creating operational policies, consider these practical approaches:

**Start by documenting what you're actually doing** rather than what you think you should be doing. Idealized processes that don't match reality will be ignored. Begin with current practices and improve incrementally.

**Use the lightest possible process** for the context. Different types of work need different levels of structure – software development might need more formal project management than community education initiatives. Design policies to accommodate this diversity.

**Create clear interfaces between teams** rather than prescribing how teams work internally. Focus on defining inputs, outputs, and coordination points while giving teams latitude in their internal processes.

**Include examples** of both standard cases and exceptions. Operational policies need to address not just the happy path, but what happens when things don't go according to plan. How are blockers addressed? How are resource constraints handled?

## Key Operational Areas

The structure of this directory reflects common operational concerns:

**Team governance** documents how groups form, evolve, and coordinate with each other. This includes team formation processes, role definitions, and cross-team collaboration frameworks.

**Resource management** covers how budgets are allocated, expenses approved, and contributions recognized. Clear resource policies prevent conflicts and ensure sustainability.

**Project lifecycle** policies define how initiatives move from ideas to implementation to completion. This includes project proposal templates, progress reporting standards, and evaluation frameworks.

As your organization evolves, you might need additional operational areas such as product development processes, quality assurance standards, knowledge management practices, or contributor development pathways.

## Maintaining Operational Autonomy

Remember that operational governance operates independently from community governance, though it remains accountable to the organization's overall agreements. When updating operational policies:

1. Involve the people who will implement the processes
2. Test changes in limited contexts before broader application  
3. Regularly review and simplify processes to prevent accumulation of unnecessary steps
4. Document not just what to do, but why it matters

The most successful operational systems evolve continuously through practice rather than being designed perfectly from the start. Create feedback loops that allow your operational policies to improve based on experience and changing circumstances.

Ultimately, good operational governance remains invisible to those outside the organization - they see only the impact of your work, not the coordination that made it possible.
