# Operational Policies

Welcome to the operations section of our policy documentation. This is where our community's values and mission transform into tangible activities and outputs. While metagovernance addresses how we make decisions, operational policies focus on what we do and how we coordinate our work together.

## Translating Purpose into Action

Operations is where purpose becomes practice. These policies create enough consistency for us to work effectively together, while preserving autonomy for teams to adapt to their specific contexts. Finding this balance is crucial â€“ too much standardization creates bureaucracy that slows work; too little creates coordination problems across teams.

Our approach gives operational governance its own authority, separate from community-wide governance processes. This autonomy is essential because operational contexts change rapidly and require specialized knowledge. Teams working directly on projects need flexibility to adapt their processes without excessive overhead.

This doesn't mean operating in isolation. All operational activities remain guided by our shared agreements and values. What autonomy does mean is that those closest to the work have appropriate agency to determine how best to accomplish their goals, creating more responsive and effective collaboration.

## How We Organize Our Work

One core aspect of operations is how we structure collaboration. Our **workgroup policies** define how teams form, evolve, and coordinate with each other. These include team formation processes, role definitions, and frameworks for cross-group collaboration.

Equally important is responsible resource management. Our **resource management policies** cover how budgets are allocated, expenses approved, and contributions recognized. Clear resource policies help prevent conflicts and ensure sustainability as we pursue our mission.

The **project lifecycle** is another crucial element. These policies define how initiatives move from ideas to implementation to completion. They include guidance on project proposals, progress tracking, and evaluation so we can learn from each effort and continuously improve our work.

## Finding Your Way

This section should be customized during implementation to reflect your organization's specific operational structure:

1. Replace these descriptions with your actual operational policy organization
2. Create links to the specific operational documents you develop
3. Consider including policies for different types of work in your organization

Your operational policies should address practical questions members have about getting work done. Depending on your focus, you might need policies for areas like:

- How work teams form and operate
- How resources are allocated and managed  
- How projects are proposed, approved, and evaluated
- How contributions are recognized or compensated
- How operational decisions are made within teams

Understanding these operational frameworks helps you engage effectively with ongoing work and contribute to new initiatives. If you're interested in joining existing workgroups or proposing new projects, these policies provide guidance on navigating those processes.

Remember that operational policies evolve continuously through practice. Unlike constitutional elements requiring broad consensus to change, operational practices adapt more fluidly based on experience and changing circumstances. If you notice opportunities to improve how we work together, the operational domain welcomes that feedback and innovation.
