# Operational Policies

Welcome to the operations section of our policy documentation. This is where our network's purpose transforms into coordinated action through autonomous cells and collaborative structures. While metagovernance addresses how decisions emerge across our network, operational policies focus on how we organize work, coordinate resources, and maintain alignment while preserving the autonomy that enables innovation.

## Translating Network Purpose into Coordinated Action

Operations is where purpose becomes practice across our distributed network. These policies create enough consistency and shared interfaces for cells to coordinate effectively, while preserving the autonomy that enables them to adapt to their specific contexts and innovate within their domains. Finding this balance is crucial – too much coordination overhead constrains the very autonomy that makes networks powerful, while too little coordination prevents us from achieving network-scale impact.

What makes our network approach distinctive is that operational governance operates with its own autonomous authority, informed by but separate from network-wide decision processes. This autonomy is essential because operational contexts change rapidly and often require specialized knowledge that exists within cells and working groups. Cells engaged in specific work need the flexibility to adapt their practices without excessive coordination overhead, enabling the responsive adaptation that gives networks advantages over hierarchical organizations.

This operational autonomy doesn't mean isolation from network purpose and values. All operational activities remain guided by our shared agreements and mission, which serves as the primary coordination mechanism enabling coherent action without centralized control. What this autonomy does mean is that those closest to the work have appropriate agency to determine how best to accomplish their goals, creating more responsive and effective collaboration that can seize opportunities as they emerge.

## How Our Network Organizes Work

One of the distinguishing features of network operations is how we enable cells (autonomous teams) to form around opportunities and coordinate across the network while maintaining their independence. Our cell governance policies define how these teams emerge, how they structure their internal operations, and how they interface with other cells and the broader network. Unlike traditional organizational units that require permission and resource allocation before forming, cells can organize spontaneously around perceived opportunities and attract resources through demonstrated value creation. These policies recognize that cells function as the fundamental units of work within our network, capable of independent action while remaining aligned with our shared purpose.

Resource flow through networks operates differently than traditional organizational resource allocation. Rather than centralized budgeting and approval processes, our resource management policies enable dynamic allocation that can respond to emerging opportunities and changing priorities. Resources naturally migrate toward areas of highest potential impact as cells demonstrate results, while unsuccessful initiatives naturally release resources back to the network—creating an intelligent allocation system that operates more like biological resource flows than bureaucratic processes. These policies cover how cells access initial resources to begin work, how they report on resource use, how successful initiatives attract additional support, and how learning from resource allocation flows back into network-wide understanding.

The network project lifecycle reflects how initiatives can emerge from any cell or collection of cells, develop through various scales of coordination, and integrate their outcomes back into network capacity and knowledge. These policies provide frameworks for project initiation that doesn't require prior permission, development processes that balance cell autonomy with network coordination, and evaluation methods that capture learning for the broader network. This lifecycle supports the permissionless innovation that characterizes healthy networks while ensuring adequate coordination for initiatives that affect multiple cells or the network as a whole.

## Finding Your Way

This section should be customized during implementation to reflect your network's specific operational structure and the kinds of work that cells typically pursue. When adapting this template:

1. Replace these placeholder descriptions with documentation that reflects how cells actually coordinate within your network
2. Create links to specific operational documents that address your network's particular work domains
3. Consider organizing policies around the types of coordination challenges your network actually encounters

Your operational policies should address the practical questions that cells and contributors have about getting work done within your network. Depending on your network's purpose and activities, you might need policies for areas like:

- How cells form around emerging opportunities and evolve over time
- How resources flow between cells and from the network to support work
- How projects that span multiple cells coordinate without losing cell autonomy  
- How contributions are recognized across different types of network participation
- How operational innovations developed by cells integrate into network-wide practice

As a participant in our network, understanding these operational frameworks helps you engage effectively with ongoing work and contribute to emergent initiatives. Whether you're interested in joining existing cells, forming new ones around opportunities you've identified, or proposing resources for network-level initiatives, these policies provide guidance on how to navigate network coordination while maintaining the autonomy to innovate.

Remember that network operational policies evolve continuously through practice and experimentation. Unlike constitutional elements that require broad consensus across the network to change, operational practices adapt more fluidly based on what cells learn from their work and changing external conditions. If you notice opportunities to improve how we coordinate as a network, the operational domain welcomes that innovation and experimentation—indeed, such bottom-up improvement is essential to maintaining our network's responsiveness and effectiveness.
