# Metagovernance Policies

This directory contains policies governing how your organization makes collective decisions, evolves governance systems, and resolves disputes. These foundational processes enable transparent, inclusive, and effective decision-making where good choices emerge from collective intelligence rather than individual authority.

## What Makes Metagovernance Different

Metagovernance is governance about governance – systems that determine how other decisions are made. These policies have special significance because they establish the rules of the game for everything else. While operational policies focus on specific activities, metagovernance creates the context in which all governance happens.

Think of metagovernance as the constitutional layer of your organization. It doesn't dictate decision content but establishes legitimate processes through which decisions can be made. This includes how proposals are created, how voting occurs, who has decision rights over what areas, and how conflicts are resolved.

Effective metagovernance strikes the right balance between stability and adaptability. Your governance system needs enough structure to be predictable and trusted, but enough flexibility to evolve as your organization grows and changes.

## Creating Effective Metagovernance

When developing policies for this domain, consider these practical approaches:

**Create tiered decision processes** that match the level of process to decision importance. Simple operational decisions shouldn't require the same process as fundamental changes to organizational purpose. Design graduated processes with different thresholds and review requirements.

**Define clear boundaries** between policy domains. Metagovernance should establish which decisions belong to which domains, but shouldn't micromanage how other domains operate internally. This respects subsidiarity – delegating authority to those closest to the impact.

**Document the "why" behind processes**, not just the "how." When people understand reasoning behind governance processes, they're more likely to respect and properly implement them even as circumstances change.

**Use practical examples** in documentation. Abstract governance concepts become clearer when illustrated with concrete scenarios members might encounter. "When X happens, here's how the process would unfold..." makes policies accessible.

## Typical Metagovernance Content

The structure of this directory reflects common metagovernance concerns:

The `proposal` directory contains processes for how ideas become formal proposals, move through deliberation, reach decisions, and get implemented. Clear proposal processes are the foundation of effective governance.

The `voting` directory establishes how collective decisions are made, including voting methods, delegation systems, and decision thresholds for different types of changes.

The `disputes` directory contains frameworks for resolving conflicts, appealing decisions, and mediating disagreements. Even the best governance systems encounter conflicts, and having predefined resolution processes prevents escalation.

As your organization evolves, you may need additional metagovernance areas such as role definition frameworks, amendment processes for foundational agreements, or inter-organizational governance for collaborations.

## Implementing Governance Changes

Changes to metagovernance policies should follow the highest standards of deliberation because they affect all other governance activities. When updating these policies:

1. Start conversations early and invite broad participation
2. Document the problem being solved and alternatives considered
3. Allow sufficient time for review and discussion
4. Consider testing changes as experiments before permanent adoption
5. Provide transition periods for substantial process changes

Remember that metagovernance isn't about controlling decision-making – it's about creating conditions where good decisions can emerge throughout your organization. The best metagovernance is often invisible, creating such clear and trusted processes that people focus on the work rather than how decisions get made.
