# Metagovernance Policies

This directory contains the policies that govern how your organization makes collective decisions, evolves its governance systems, and resolves disputes. These are the foundational processes that allow for transparent, inclusive, and effective governance.

## What Makes Metagovernance Different

Metagovernance is governance about governance - the systems that determine how other decisions are made. These policies have special significance because they establish the rules of the game for everything else. While operational or platform policies focus on specific activities, metagovernance policies create the context in which all governance happens.

Think of metagovernance as the constitutional layer of your organization. It doesn't dictate the content of decisions, but rather establishes the legitimate processes through which decisions can be made. This includes how proposals are created, how voting occurs, who has decision rights over what areas, and how conflicts are resolved.

What makes effective metagovernance challenging is striking the right balance between stability and adaptability. Your governance system needs enough structure to be predictable and trusted, but enough flexibility to evolve as your organization grows and changes.

## Creating Effective Metagovernance

When developing policies for this domain, consider these practical approaches:

Create tiered decision processes that match the level of process to the importance of the decision. Simple operational decisions shouldn't require the same process as fundamental changes to your organization's purpose. Design graduated processes with different thresholds and review requirements.

Define clear boundaries between policy domains. Metagovernance should establish which decisions belong to which domains, but it shouldn't micromanage how other domains operate internally. This respects the principle of subsidiarity - delegating authority to those closest to the impact.

Document the "why" behind processes, not just the "how." When people understand the reasoning behind a governance process, they're more likely to respect and properly implement it even as circumstances change.

Use practical examples in your documentation. Abstract governance concepts become much clearer when illustrated with concrete scenarios that members might encounter. "When X happens, here's how the process would unfold..." makes policies accessible.

## Typical Metagovernance Content

The structure of this directory reflects common metagovernance concerns:

The `proposal` directory contains processes for how ideas become formal proposals, move through deliberation, reach decisions, and get implemented. Clear proposal processes are the foundation of effective governance.

The `voting` directory establishes how collective decisions are made, including voting methods, delegation systems, and decision thresholds for different types of changes.

The `disputes` directory contains frameworks for resolving conflicts, appealing decisions, and mediating disagreements. Even the best governance systems encounter conflicts, and having predefined resolution processes prevents escalation.

As your organization evolves, you may need additional metagovernance areas such as:

- Role definition and delegation frameworks
- Amendments to foundational agreements
- Inter-organizational governance (for collaborations)

## Implementing Governance Changes

Changes to metagovernance policies should follow the highest standards of deliberation and consensus because they affect all other governance activities. When updating these policies:

1. Start conversations early and invite broad participation
2. Document the problem being solved and alternatives considered
3. Allow sufficient time for review and discussion
4. Consider testing significant changes as experiments before permanent adoption
5. Provide transition periods for substantial process changes

Remember that metagovernance isn't about controlling all decision-making - it's about creating the conditions where good decisions can emerge throughout your organization. The best metagovernance is often invisible, creating such clear and trusted processes that people focus on the work rather than how decisions get made.
