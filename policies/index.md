# Policy Registry

Welcome to our policy repository, where we maintain the living documents that guide how we work together. While our agreements establish the foundational relationships between members, policies translate our shared values into practical action. They create the frameworks for decision-making, resource allocation, and collaboration that allow us to operate effectively as a community.

## Understanding Our Approach to Governance

A key principle of our governance design is subsidiarity – the idea that decisions should be made by those closest to their impact. This means we don't centralize all authority in one place. Instead, we distribute decision-making across different domains, each with its own appropriate level of autonomy.

You'll notice this policy section is organized into distinct domains like Metagovernance, Operations, and Platforms. This isn't just an organizational convenience; it reflects actual boundaries of decision-making authority in our community. Each domain has its own governance processes as defined in our foundational agreements.

For instance, the people maintaining our digital platforms have the authority to establish appropriate access controls and security measures without requiring approval from the entire community for every technical decision. Similarly, operational teams have the flexibility to develop workflows that meet their specific needs while remaining aligned with our shared purpose.

This approach allows us to balance coherence with adaptability. By documenting all policies in one central location, we ensure transparency and accessibility. At the same time, by distributing governance authority, we enable those with relevant expertise to respond quickly to changing circumstances in their domains.

## Navigating Our Policies

Whether you're a new member trying to understand how we operate or a longtime contributor looking for specific guidance, you'll find our policies organized into these primary domains:

[Metagovernance](metagovernance/) contains the processes through which we make collective decisions, evolve our governance, and resolve disputes. These are the constitutional elements of our organization – the frameworks that establish how other decisions are legitimately made.

[Operations](operations/) covers how our work gets done – how teams form, how resources are allocated, how projects are managed, and how contributions are recognized. These policies translate our purpose into practical action and coordination.

[Platforms](platforms/) addresses our digital infrastructure – the tools, systems, and online spaces where we collaborate. These policies ensure our technical foundation supports rather than hinders our community's work.

Each domain's index page will guide you to more specific policies relevant to your questions or interests. If you're unsure where to look, the metagovernance section is a good starting point, as it provides context for how all other governance processes function.

## Living Documentation

Our policies evolve as we learn and grow as an organization. Each policy domain follows its own process for reviewing and updating documentation, as defined in our agreements. When policies change, we maintain version history so you can understand not just what our current practices are, but how they've evolved over time.

We encourage all members to familiarize themselves with these policies, particularly those most relevant to your participation. Understanding our governance framework empowers you to engage effectively and contribute to its ongoing improvement.
