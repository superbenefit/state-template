# Policy Registry

Welcome to our policy repository, where we maintain the living documents that guide how we coordinate as a network. While our agreements establish the foundational relationships between members, policies translate our shared purpose into practical frameworks for decision-making, resource allocation, and collaboration that enable us to operate effectively as a decentralized network.

## Understanding Our Network Governance Approach

A key principle of our governance design is subsidiarity – the idea that decisions should be made by those closest to their impact. This reflects our understanding of DAOs as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams (cells) rather than traditional hierarchical entities. Instead of centralizing all authority in one place, we distribute decision-making across different domains and scales, each with its own appropriate level of autonomy.

You'll notice this policy section is organized into distinct domains like Metagovernance, Operations, and Platforms. This isn't just an organizational convenience; it reflects actual boundaries of decision-making authority in our network. Each domain has its own governance processes as defined in our foundational agreements, enabling the network to coordinate across diverse stakeholder groups while maintaining the autonomy that allows different participants to contribute their unique perspectives and capabilities.

For instance, those maintaining our digital platforms have the authority to establish appropriate access controls and security measures without requiring approval from the entire network for every technical decision. Similarly, operational cells have the flexibility to develop workflows that meet their specific contexts while remaining aligned with our shared purpose - the primary coordination mechanism that enables coherent action without centralized control. This distributed approach extends naturally to inter-network collaboration, where our cells and participants coordinate with counterparts in other DAOs through shared protocols rather than formal institutional agreements.

This approach allows us to balance coherence with adaptability across different scales. By documenting all policies in one central location, we ensure transparency and accessibility throughout the network. At the same time, by distributing governance authority appropriately, we enable those with relevant expertise and context to respond quickly to changing circumstances in their domains, fostering the emergent strategy that characterizes healthy networks.

## Navigating Network Policies

Whether you're a new member trying to understand how our network operates or a longtime contributor looking for specific guidance, you'll find our policies organized into these primary domains that reflect different aspects of network coordination:

[Metagovernance](metagovernance/) contains the processes through which we make collective decisions, evolve our governance, and resolve disputes across the network. These represent the constitutional elements that establish how other decisions are legitimately made within our distributed system. This domain recognizes that in a network, strategy emerges autonomously from the collective intelligence of participants rather than being dictated from a central authority.

[Operations](operations/) covers how our network's work gets done – how cells form and coordinate, how resources flow through the network, how projects emerge and develop, and how contributions are recognized. These policies translate our purpose into practical action and coordination across diverse stakeholder groups, creating frameworks that enable different types of participants to coordinate effectively while maintaining their distinct approaches and expertise.

[Platforms](platforms/) addresses our digital infrastructure – the tools, systems, and online spaces where our network collaborates. These policies ensure our technical foundation supports rather than hinders our community's distributed work, creating the digital substrate upon which our network coordination occurs.

Each domain's index page will guide you to more specific policies relevant to your questions or interests. If you're unsure where to look, the metagovernance section provides essential context for how all other governance processes function within our network structure.

## Living Network Documentation

Our policies evolve as we learn and grow as a network, constantly adapting to new opportunities and challenges while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose. Each policy domain follows its own process for reviewing and updating documentation, as defined in our agreements. When policies change, we maintain version history so you can understand not just what our current practices are, but how they've evolved through our collective experience and learning.

We encourage all network participants to familiarize themselves with these policies, particularly those most relevant to your level of participation. Understanding our governance framework empowers you to engage effectively with the three essential freedoms that create collective intelligence in our network: the freedom to work on something without requiring permission, the ability to attract others to work on a project, and the right to put up proposals to the broader network. These freedoms extend beyond our organizational boundaries, enabling participants to initiate cross-network collaborations and contribute to the broader ecosystem of interconnected DAOs, creating emergent coordination patterns that make networks collectively more adaptive and resilient than isolated organizations.
