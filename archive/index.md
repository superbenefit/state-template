# Governance Archives

The Governance Archives preserve the history of collective decision-making, serving as institutional memory that demonstrates how our organization has evolved through inclusive governance. This registry contains historical proposals and governance records, providing transparency into how we have developed through collaborative decision-making.

These archives play several essential roles in governance. They provide a transparent record of decisions and their implementation, helping new members understand our evolution. They enable accountability by allowing verification that approved decisions were implemented as intended. They preserve valuable insights from past experiences and maintain institutional knowledge across changing membership, ensuring continuity in governance practices.

Rather than simply storing decisions, these archives illuminate how participants contributed to collective choices and how their perspectives enriched governance outcomes. This context strengthens collective intelligence by providing examples of how collaboration leads to more effective decision-making.

## Archive Contents

Our archives maintain several types of historical governance records:

The [Proposal Archive](proposals/) contains formal governance proposals that have been submitted for consideration. Each archived proposal includes its original text, voting outcome, and implementation status. This archive maintains records of approved, rejected, and withdrawn proposals to provide a complete picture of governance history.

Additional archive types may include treasury records, working group documentation, event records, or protocol changes depending on your organization's needs.

## Using This Registry

Whether you're a new member seeking to understand governance history or an active contributor researching past decisions, the archives provide valuable context for meaningful participation.

New members can explore significant proposals to understand how key decisions shaped our current structure. Active governance participants can research similar past proposals, identify successful decision patterns, or reference previous decisions in current discussions.

To locate specific information within the archives, you can search repository history for specific terms, navigate through archive folders organized by type or date, or search commit messages for governance changes. When referencing archived materials in discussions, using consistent formatting helps maintain clarity and enables others to find relevant context.

When citing archived decisions, include the proposal title, date, outcome status, and relevant link to help others locate and verify the information.
