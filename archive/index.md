# Governance Archives

The Governance Archives preserve the history of collective decision-making, serving as the institutional memory of the organization. This registry contains historical proposals and other governance records, providing transparency into how the organization has evolved over time.

These archives play several important roles in decentralized governance. They provide a record of decisions and their implementation, helping new members understand the organization's evolution. They enable accountability by allowing members to verify that approved decisions were implemented as intended. The archives contain valuable insights from past experiences and maintain organizational knowledge across changing membership, ensuring continuity in governance practices.

## Archive Contents

Our archives maintain several types of historical governance records:

The [Proposal Archive](proposals/) contains formal governance proposals that have been submitted for consideration. Each archived proposal includes its original text, voting outcome, and implementation status. This archive maintains records of approved, rejected, and withdrawn proposals to provide a complete picture of governance history.

Additionally, the Git repository itself serves as an archive through its commit history, pull requests, and version control features, providing another layer of transparency into governance evolution.

## Using This Registry

Whether you're a new member trying to understand governance history or a contributor researching past decisions, the archives provide valuable context. New members might begin by reviewing significant proposals to understand key decisions, while governance participants can use the archives to research similar past proposals or reference previous decisions in discussions.

To locate specific information within the archives, you can use repository search with specific terms, navigate through archive folders, or search commit messages for governance changes. When referencing archived materials in discussions or proposals, using a consistent format that includes the proposal title, link, status, and date helps maintain clarity.

The archives reflect the organization's governance history from inception to present. As governance processes complete, new materials are added, creating an ongoing record of collective decisions. The archives are a shared resource maintained by the community through established governance processes.
