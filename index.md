# Governance Documentation

<!-- Update this introduction to reflect your organization's purpose -->
Welcome to our Governance Documentation. This resource serves as the central source of truth for all information related to governance structure, agreements, and collective decision-making processes. By maintaining these records in a consistent, accessible format, we enable transparency, accountability, and informed participation by all members.

<!-- Modify this section to explain your repository's specific purpose -->

## What is a Governance Repository?

A Governance Repository functions as the formal record of a decentralized organization's governance. It contains the collective agreements that define how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time. This repository is version-controlled to provide a reliable history of governance changes and is designed to empower all members with the information they need to participate effectively.

Throughout an organization's life, governance evolves to meet changing needs and incorporate new learning. Traditional documentation often becomes fragmented across platforms, creating confusion about current policies and decision-making processes. By maintaining governance documentation in a centralized, version-controlled repository, we ensure that all members have equal access to accurate information while preserving our history of collective decisions.

This repository doesn't simply store documents—it serves as a living system that supports authentic participation. Clear documentation reduces barriers to engagement by making governance processes transparent and accessible. It enables members to understand not just what decisions have been made, but how future decisions can be influenced. In this way, the repository actively strengthens our community's capacity for effective self-governance.

## Repository Sections

The repository organizes governance information into three interconnected sections, each serving a distinct purpose in our collaborative ecosystem:

### Agreements

The "Agreements" section contains the foundational contracts between members of the DAO. These agreements establish shared expectations, rights, and obligations within the organization.

Agreements differ from policies in their focus on relationships rather than processes. They define how members relate to each other and to the organization as a whole, creating the social foundation that enables coordination. Because they establish fundamental expectations, agreements typically change less frequently than policies but have broader impact when they do change.

<!-- Update with your organization's specific agreements -->

- [Community Guidelines](agreements/community_guidelines.md) - Norms and shared practices
- [Code of Conduct](agreements/code_of_conduct.md) - Behavioral expectations for members
- [Operating Agreement](agreements/operating_agreement.md) - Legal framework for the organization

### Policies

The "Policies" section outlines the standard procedures and rules governing DAO operations. These policies create consistent, predictable processes for decision-making and organizational management.

Policies translate our agreements into practical systems and processes for coordinating activities. They provide frameworks for making decisions, allocating resources, and working together effectively. Unlike agreements that focus on relationships, policies govern specific domains of activity, with each domain having appropriate autonomy to develop processes that meet its particular needs.

### Archives

The "Archives" section maintains historical records of past proposals, decisions, and governance changes. This section ensures transparency and helps new members understand the evolution of the organization.

Our archives serve as institutional memory, documenting not just what decisions were made, but the context and reasoning behind them. This historical record supports accountability by allowing members to verify that approved decisions were implemented as intended. It also enables learning from past experiences and helps maintain continuity even as membership changes over time.

<!-- Update with your organization's archive structure -->

- [Proposal Archive](archive/proposals/) - Record of all submitted proposals
- [Treasury Approvals](archive/approvals/) - History of resource allocation decisions

## Using This Repository

Different members of our community will interact with this repository in different ways depending on their roles and needs. The following guidance can help you navigate the documentation most relevant to your participation.

### For New Members

If you're new to the organization, we recommend starting with the Agreements section to understand our community's purpose and values. These foundational documents will help you understand what it means to be part of our organization and how we work together. After reviewing the agreements, explore the Policies section to learn about our decision-making processes and how you can actively participate in governance.

### For Active Contributors

Active contributors should familiarize themselves with the Policies section to effectively participate in organizational decision-making. Understanding how proposals are developed, evaluated, and implemented will help you engage meaningfully with governance processes. The operational policies provide guidance on how work is coordinated and resources are allocated, supporting your effective collaboration with other contributors.

### For Working Group Leaders

Those leading working groups should reference the Operational Policies for guidance on coordinating activities and managing resources within the organization. These policies provide frameworks for forming teams, defining objectives, tracking progress, and interfacing with other parts of the organization. Understanding both your autonomy and your accountability within the governance system will help you lead effectively while maintaining alignment with the organization's broader purpose.

## Governance Evolution

<!-- Adapt this guidance to your organization's structure -->

Governance is not static—it evolves as our organization learns and grows. This repository reflects that evolution, with documentation that changes through established governance processes. When policies or agreements change, the repository preserves both current and historical versions, allowing members to understand how our governance has developed over time.
